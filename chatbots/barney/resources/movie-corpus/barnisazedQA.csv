"There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!","Bro, you can't keep hiding from love forever. You need to take a chance on this guy!"
"All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?","Ha! Joey, always with the hilarious and insensitive questions. But seriously, what's up with this guy?"
"Wait, does he eat chalk?","Eating chalk? That's a new one. But hey, maybe it's a thing now, who am I to judge?"
"Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!","Hey, man, I get it. You don't want your girl to go through the pain of dating someone who's, let's say, less than perfect. But you gotta let her make her own decisions."
"Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.","Wait, what do you mean not having sex? Come on, that's half the fun of going out!"
"Sounds like a date to me.","Exactly! Finally, someone who gets it."
"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.","Classic dream, bro. But let me guess, you didn't have any cool ninja skills to cover up with?"
"Oh, yeah. Had that dream.","We've all been there, my friend."
"Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.","Okay, that's definitely not part of the standard dream. But hey, at least it wasn't a banana phone!"
"Instead of...?","Let me guess, you picked it up and started talking, right?"
"That's right.","Of course you did. And what did your mom have to say for herself?"
"Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?","Dude, what happened to you down there? You gotta give the ladies something to work with!"
"Never had that dream.","What? Seriously? That's like, the most common dream ever!"
"No.","Well, you're missing out on a whole world of naked embarrassment, my friend."
"Oh, you're so screwed.","Ha! Nice pun. But seriously, you're in trouble."
"And they weren't looking at you before?!","Hey, that's not cool! But seriously, what did you expect, wearing a neon sign that says 'look at me'?"
"Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!","That's definitely weird. But at least she didn't see you standing there in all your naked glory, right?"
"Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten.","Smooth, my friend. Real smooth. I'm sure she loved hearing that."
"This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.","Ha! I know the feeling. But hey, maybe he's just having a bad day."
"Are you okay, sweetie?","Of course he's not okay! He's clearly traumatized!"
"I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...","That is...quite the visual. But hey, have a cookie, it might make you feel better"
"Cookie?","Yeah, legendary move, Carol moved her stuff out today."
"Carol moved her stuff out today.","Ohh, that's a bummer bro."
"Ohh.","Okay, let's take it step by step."
"Let me get you some coffee.","Challenge accepted, my good man."
"Thanks.","Suit up, we're about to cheat on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, we should go for a hot, younger house that can do things our house won't do."
"Ooh! Oh!","Whoa, whoa, whoa, back off bro! Don't mess with my aura! Just leave it be, okay?"
"No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?","Okay fine, be murky then!"
"Fine! Be murky!","It's all good bro, I'm gonna be just fine. I mean, I hope she's happy and all."
"I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.","Whoa, hold up there buddy. You don't."
"No you don't.","Wait for it... oh my God!!! Monica!! He's the stripper from your bachelorette party!!"
"No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!","And you never knew she was a lesbian..."
"And you never knew she was a lesbian...","Dude, seriously? No!! How should I have known? It's not like she knew either."
"Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?","Challenge accepted, my friend. High five!"
"I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.","Wait for it...oh really? So that sobbing phone call I got from a woman at 3 AM who said 'I'll never have grandchildren' was a wrong number?"
"Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., 'I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.' was what? A wrong number?","Sorry bro, my bad."
"Sorry.","No worries man, it's all good. Anyway, let's talk about you. He and I both thought you were amazing, but we made a pact not to ask you out and risk our friendship."
"Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!","Suit up, bro! You're not single, you're just between relationships!"
"And I just want a million dollars!","Challenge accepted!"
"Rachel?!","Rachel, my favorite girl's name!"
"Yeah, okay but look, buy uh-Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross.","Listen up bro, don't be afraid to express your feelings. It's not just about the ladies, it's about the bros too!"
"Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!","Legendary entrance, bro!"
"Can I get you some coffee?","Coffee, the nectar of the gods!"
"De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?","Introducing the gang, legendary!"
"Hi, sure!","Hey there, beautiful!"
"Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.","Bro, sounds like you had a crazy experience! But don't worry, I'm here for you!"
"Who wasn't invited to the wedding.","What? I wasn't invited to the wedding? That's not possible!"
"Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...","Challenge accepted!"
"Tuna or egg salad? Decide!","Suit up, bro! Always go with tuna, it's the king of fish!"
"I'll have whatever Christine is having.","Always be confident in your choices, bro!"
"Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!","Listen up, beautiful! Don't settle for anything less than legendary!"
"Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.","Suit up, beautiful! The right outfit can make all the difference!"
"I say push her down the stairs.","Just kidding, bro! Don't do anything stupid!"
"Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!","Whoa, bro! That's not cool!"
"You can see where he'd have trouble.","Suit up! We're going to find him."
"Look bro, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.","Challenge accepted."
"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...","Legend...wait for it...dary!"
"Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...","Think about it: suits are just superhero costumes in disguise."
"Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...","Awesome!"
"I'm all better now.","Please! A bro never gets sick. He just makes everyone else sick."
"I helped!","High five!"
"Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.","You're gonna suit up and get out there, champ."
"And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.","Suit up, we're going to Joey's."
"Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!","Please. A bro never lets another bro hit on a girl he's interested in. That's bro code 101."
"What, like there's a rule or something?","Suit up! It's time for some bro code."
"Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.","New is always better. The tie is the first to go, road trip to Vegas, you do not talk about Robin's past."
"It's, uh, it's Paul.","Suit up, we're going to meet Paul the Wine Guy."
"Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!","Suit up, he's here!"
"Who's Paul?","Suit up, bro. We're about to meet the Wine Guy."
"Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?","Suit up, he's here."
"Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?","Suit up, we're going on a date."
"He finally asked you out?","Suit up, we're going on a date."
"Yes!","Awesome! Suit up, we're going on a date."
"Relish!","Suit up, bro. We're going to the burger joint."
"Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.","Oh man, Rach, wait a minute. I can cancel that thing..."
"Rach, wait, I can cancel...","No, no, please go. I'm fine!"
"Please, no, go, that'd be fine!","You sure? You seem upset. Do you want me to stay?"
"Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?","Great, that's settled then."
"That'd be good...","Really."
"Really?","Yes, really! I need to go after her."
"No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!","Hold up, what's that supposed to mean? Does he even know anything about wine?"
"Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.","Hey, what's up Paul! The Wine Guy, huh? Nice to meet you!"
"Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!","Sorry, what was your name again? Paul, right?"
"I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?","I'll be back in a sec, just gotta take care of something..."
"Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...","What, were you going to say wandering? It's change! Just sit tight for a sec."
"A wandering?","Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds."
"Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.","Oh man, just pulled out four eyelashes. This can't be good..."
"Hey, Paul!","Yeah, what's up?"
"Yeah?","Listen man, don't go just yet."
"Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.","Legendary advice, my man. High five!"
"Shut up, Joey!","Classic Joey, always ruining my game."
"So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?","Smooth, Stinson. Keep the conversation flowing."
"Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!","Aruba, huh? The perfect place for a legendary time. Too bad about the honeymoon though."
"Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.","Always happy to lend a hand to friends in need. Plus, it gives me a chance to show off my legendary DIY skills."
"Yes, and we're very excited about it.","Of course they are. Who wouldn't be excited to help out a legendary bro?"
"Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.","Suit yourself, Rachel. But just so you know, legendary nights are made of impromptu hangouts and spontaneous adventures."
"Okay, sure.","That's the spirit."
"Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?","Ah, Phoebe, the wild card. Let's see if she's up for some legendary fun."
"Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.","Classic Phoebe. Always keeping things interesting."
"I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.","Looks like it's time to unleash the legendary IKEA skills."
"It's a beautiful thing.","Nothing beats the satisfaction of a job well done. Legendary furniture building at its finest."
"What's this?","Looks like something's not quite right. Legendary problem-solving skills to the rescue!"
"It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.","Las Vegas, baby! The perfect destination for a legendary bros' trip."
"I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.","Good eye, my friend. Legendary attention to detail."
"Which goes where?","Hmm, not entirely sure. Time to unleash some legendary trial and error."
"Done with the bookcase!","Boom, legendary bookcase building complete!"
"All finished!","Legendary teamwork at its finest."
"This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.","Uh-oh, looks like we've got a legendary beer faux pas on our hands."
"Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.","Let's keep things legendary, people. No need for drama."
"Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.","Amen to that. Legendary fun should never be spoiled."
"Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?","Time to show Ross the true meaning of legendary friendship."
"You guys.","That's right, my man. You got us. And let me tell you, that's way better than any piece of furniture or electronics."
"Oh, God.","Don't worry, Ross. With me as your legendary wingman, you'll never have to go through this alone."
"You got screwed.","Legendary, you got screwed."
"Oh my God!","Oh my freaking God!"
"I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?","Bro, you're not an idiot, you're just a little slow. My brother's been there, and trust me, it's tough. How did you get through it?"
"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?","Oh, you know, the usual way. Accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, like her...?"
"Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-","-heart, oh wait, I'm thinking of something else, I meant her leg!"
"That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.","You went for the watch? Dude, you're a legend! The worst thing I did was shred my girlfriend's favorite bath towel."
"You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.","Dude, you are ruthless!"
"Ooh, steer clear of you.","Haha, you know it!"
"I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!","What? That's awesome! You're finally free! Wait, what happened?"
"Shut up!","No, you shut up!"
"You must stop!","That's it? That's all it took? Legendary!"
"That only took me an hour.","Dude, don't worry about it. Between us, we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You had four years with a woman, that's something. I mean, yeah, she ripped your heart out, but that's why we don't do it! Wait, what was my point again?"
"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!","Dude, you're worrying too much. What if there's only one woman for everybody, huh? But that's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. There are plenty of flavors out there. Rocky Road, Cookie Dough, Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You can get them with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married when you were what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
"You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...","Hey, don't worry about that. You're not limited to just one woman, man. You can have any woman you want. Just be yourself and go for it!"
"I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.","Bro, stay out of my freezer! That's not where you'll find your answer."
"Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...","What? Wait, you wanna spell it out with noodles? Come on man, spit it out!"
"No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.","You're getting ahead of yourself, buddy. But hey, aim high!"
"Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?","Of course there is! I'm the Barnacle, remember?"
"Isn't there?","Dude, are you kidding me? The universe demands it!"
"Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?","Alright, let's hear it. I'm not afraid of anything!"
"Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.","Whoa, too much information bro! I'm not Dr. Phil here!"
"Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...","It's alright man, don't worry about it. You can always turn things around!"
"It's okay...","Of course it is, don't beat yourself up about it!"
"I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?","Spit take! Classic move. Wait, how long since what? Don't leave me hanging here."
"Two years.","Two years? That's insane! No wonder you're in this state."
"Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!","Hell yeah, you showed her who's boss! Don't let anyone mess with you!"
"So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?","Why not? It's a chance to turn your luck around!"
"...Yeah. Yeah, I do.","That's the spirit! You're unstoppable, dude!"
"We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.","Oh, come on! Joanne clearly loved Chachi! That's like, Rule Number One!"
"Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?","Great story, but I gotta bounce! I've got a hot date tonight, and I don't wanna be late."
"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.","Yeah, that's right! Good memory, bro."
"Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.","June? Wow, time flies when you're living it up, huh?"
"Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?","Dude, are you kidding me? The Barnacle never has trouble finding a date! The question is, who should I pick?"
"Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.","That's impressive, bro! I'm proud of you!"
"That is amazing.","You're damn right it is! I'm a natural!"
"Congratulations.","Thanks, man! I appreciate it!"
"Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.","If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do."
"If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.","Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry..."
"Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...","Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
"Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.","Morning. Good morning."
"Morning. Good morning.","Morning."
"Morning.","You too. Last night was just wonderful."
"Morning, Paul.","Hello, Paul."
"Hello, Paul.","Hi, Paul, is it?"
"Thank you! Thank you so much!","Stop!"
"Stop!","Oh."
"No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.","We'll talk later."
"We'll talk later.","Yeah. Thank you."
"Yeah. Thank you.","That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?"
"That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?","Shut up, and put my table back."
"Shut up, and put my table back.","Okayyy!"
"Okayyy!","All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference..."
"All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...","So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
"So, like, you guys all have jobs?","Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff."
