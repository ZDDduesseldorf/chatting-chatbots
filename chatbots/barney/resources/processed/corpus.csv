"Hey, you wanna do something tonight?","Okay, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes, and Suit up!"
"Hey.","Where's your suit!? Just once when I say suit up, I wish you'd put on a suit."
"I did that one time.","It was a blazer!"
"You know, ever since college it's been Marshall and Lily and me. Now it's going to be Marshall and Lily... and me. They'll get married, start a family-before long I'm the weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call ""Uncle Ted"".","I see what this is about. Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met?"
"Oh, right. Hi.","Lesson one, lose the goatee. It doesn't look good with your suit."
"I'm not wearing a suit.","Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A."
"Thirty, right. You're right. I guess it's just, you're best friend gets engaged-you start thinking about that stuff.","I thought I was your best friend. Ted, say I'm your best friend."
"You're my best friend, Barney.","Good! And as your best friend, I suggest we play a little game called... ""Have you met Ted?"""
"Wai-no, no, no. We're not playing ""Have You Met Ted?""",""
"Why am I freaking out all of a sudden? This is crazy! I'm not ready to settle down.","how does Carl land a Lebanese girl?"
"It's always been ""don't even think about it till you're thirty""","Exactly-the guy doesn't even own a suit!"
"Hey Barney, see that girl?","Hey, have you met Ted?"
"that was fun.","De-wait for it-nied! Denied!"
"We're going out tomorrow night.","I thought we were playing laser tag tomorrow night?"
"Ted, anyone who's single would tell you the same thing. Even the dumbest single person alive, and if you don't believe me...call him.","Hey loser, how's not playing laser tag? Because playing laser tag is awesome! Oh, I k*ll you Connor; don't make me get your mom!"
"Hey, listen. I need your opinion on something.","Okay, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes-AND SUIT UP!"
"So these guys think I chickened out. What do you think?","I can't believe you're still not wearing a SUIT!"
"She didn't even give me the signal.","What is she goanna-is she goanna bat her eyes at you in Morse code Kiss me-No, you just kiss her!"
"Not if you don't get the signal.","Ee-(Kisses Marshal) Did Marshall give me the signal?"
"No! I didn't, I swear.","But see-at least, tonight, I get to sleep knowing, Marshall and Me... never going to happen. You should've kissed her."
"Urgh, I should've kissed her. What about when she gets back from Orlando?","A week? That's like-a year in hot girl time. She'll forget all about you. Mark my words: you will never see that one again."
"I never do anything crazy! I'm always waiting for the moment! Planning the moment! Well she's leaving tomorrow this may be the only moment I'm goanna get! I gotta do what that guy couldn't, I gotta take the leap! Okay not a perfect metaphor, for me it's fall in love and get married-for him it's... death.","Actually, that is a perfect metaphor. By the way, did I congratulate you two?"
"..Barney?","Alright, but under one condition."
"","Know, that was a big mistake, Ted. You should've done it in person."
"Marshall, remember this night. When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech, you're goanna tell this story.","Why does he get to be the best man? I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND!"
"Go back in there!","You're wearing a suit!"
"He's in.","So, Ranjit... you must've done it with a Lebanese girl."
"Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.","The women hot there?"
"Here's a picture of my wife!","She's lovely."
"Yeah...","You hate olives? Lily loves them, you can't stand them."
"Yeah, hate olives.","Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th Street, dish of olives-you had some. What up?"
"You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.","I swear."
"On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad; Lily asked if she could have my olives. I said, ""Sure... I hate olives.""","But you like olives!"
"Well, I was eighteen, okay? I was a virgin. Been waiting for my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.","Marshall, I'm going to get you an early wedding present. Don't get married."
"It's been like twenty minutes. You think they're doin' it?","You think they're doing it in front of the dogs?"
"Doggie style.","I had this girl in college; she had a golden retriever-"
"Okay, we can go to the bar, just stop talking.","Hit it Ranjit."
"That long lingering handshake-you should've kissed her!","There's no such thing as the signal. But yeah-that was the signal."
"Guys, trust me. I've seen the signal. That was not the signal.","Yeah Ted, we're not on you anymore."
"Right, so back in 2005 when I was twenty-seven, my two best friends got engaged. And it got me thinking, ""Maybe I should get married."" Then I saw... Robin. She was incredible. I just knew I had to meet her. That's where your Uncle Barney came in.","I suggest we play a little game I like to call, ""Have you Met Ted?"""
"No, no, no-we're not playing ""Have you Met Ted!""",""
"I'm in love with her.","No! As your sponsor I will not let you relapse. You blew it; it's over-move on."
"We are now-Casual","Yeah, cuz nothing says ""Casual"" like inviting a hundred people over just to ""Mac"" on one girl. Oh, and Lily-that's my leg."
"Get her up to the roof and the roof takes care of the rest.","What's so special about the roof?"
"We do it up there sometimes.","Solid plan, my little friend."
"We're the same height.","But may I suggest one little modification."
"That's not the plan.","Should be the plan, I mean look at her. Ted, look at her. She's smokin'!"
"Barney, I don't wanna say-","Aargh! Scoping, beep, scoping, beep!"
"Man you're a dork.","beep, beep, beep, beep. Target acquired! And now it's time we play a little game I like to call ""Have You Met Ted?"""
"No, come on not this.","Hi! Have you met Ted?"
"Hi.","Hi."
"No.","My God, have you ever had the baby! It is just behind me, huh?"
"I work with Carlos.","Excuse me, Anyone know a Carlos?"
"I don't think so.","Your loss, her gain. Excuse me, can I show you the roof? It's magical up there!"
"Whoa-whoa-Hey hey. I got that roof reserved!","Dude, Robin's not coming."
"Scene Five","Oh, you were so right about the roof. The roof. The roof is on fire, Ted! Girl from last night, took her back to my place then this morning took her outside, spun her around a couple of times sent her walking-she will never find her way back and there she is. How did she get here? Did you invite her?"
"I have no idea who that is.","She said she works with Carlos, who's Carlos?"
"I don't know any Carlos.","Grr. Hi, you. You're back."
"I sure am. Come on, sweetie, I need a drink.","""sweetie""? Really? Sweetie?"
"Alright.","So, it's over between me-and-works with Carlos girl."
"Oh, that was fast.","Yeah, I was trying to think what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met?"
"So I threw a third party for Robin. On a Sunday night","Oh, this is lame."
"lame or ""Casual""?","lame."
"Hello, Barney.","Of course."
"You look well. Isn't it weird they invited both of us?","Who? Who invited you? No one even know who you are!"
"I understand you're hurt, but, you don't have to be cruel. Carlos was right about you.","Who is Carlos!?"
"She's not just ""one of them"" she's the one.","Yeah well, ""the one"" is heading up to ""the roof""."
"You jealous?","Oh, please, what does Carlos have that I don't?"
"Ohh!!","I'm not sure I like her."
"What's wrong with MacLaren's?",""
"I had no idea why I hung out with Barney.","You didn't phone-five did you? I know when you don't phone-five, Ted. Come on, we always go to MacLaren's."
"Yeah, cause MacLaren's is fun...","MacLaren's is this much fun. What I'm offering is the chance to have this much fun."
"See, you say that. You say it's going to be this much fun. But most of the time it ends up being this much fun. This much fun is good! It's safe. It's guaranteed!","This hand gesture thing doesn't really work on the phone, does it?"
"No it doesn't.","Get in the cab. Marshall you too."
"Oh, I wish I could... I think Lily and I are just goi...","I understand. Get in the cab."
"Why can Marshall say no?","Uhh... because he's getting laid."
"Consistently.",""
"It's not a rut, okay. It's a routine and I like it!","Ted, what's the first syllable in rutting"
"Alright, so what's this legendary plan.","First we got to pick someone up at the airport."
"Okay, I'm outta here.",""
"Why do you have those suitcases, and who are we picking up?","I don't know. Maybe her? Or her."
"Wait so when you said you were going to ""pick someone up at the airport"". You meant you were going to ""pick someone up at the airport"".","Scenario. Couple of girls fly into town, looking for a fun weekend in NYC when they meet two handsome international business men just back from a lucrative trip to Japan. Sample dialogue, ""You have a wheelie bag? Wh... I have a wheelie bag!"""
"You've gotta be kidding me.","False. Sidebar, tuck in your shirt. You look sketchy."
"I'm sketchy?","Trust me, it's going to be legendary."
"Alright, um, I think we need to refine our back-story first. How did we...","Ted, you klutzy, great guy, you!"
"Philadelphia.","Philly? That's where we're headed!"
"You are? Well...uh...guess we'll see you on the plane.","Yes, you will. Follow them, tickets on me."
"That is awesome.","Hey, is that Marshall? Marshall, stop whatever you're doing, get in that hoopty-ass Vierro of yours and come meet us in Philly. It's going to be legendary."
"Man, I wish I could, guys, but...","Yeah, yeah, yeah... I sent you some pictures on my phone, check it. Admit it, you're having fun. This much fun. Thirty-five thousand feet of fun!"
"Well I didn't think we'd be on a flying to Philadelphia when I woke up this morning, I'll give you that.","Let's go talk to those girls."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, the seatbelt light is on.","Ted, you've been living your whole life in a seatbelt. It's time to unclick."
"Sir, seatbelt light's on.","Yeah, sorry, sorry."
"Barney, I am going to k*ll you.","Don't say you're going to k*ll someone in front of airport security, not cool. Not cool."
"We got footage of you placing two bags on JFK carousel three, and abandoning them to purchase a last minute flight with cash.","Those bags were your responsibility."
"Look, this is all just... it's a misunderstanding.","We are international businessmen. My colleague accidentally left the bags there now please let us go before we miss our international business meeting."
"Can't remember the last time I saw an international business man with an untucked shirt. In addition, we received this footage taken over the last few months.","Believe it or not, that duff bag thing worked."
"Yes, he's that lame. Tell them you're that lame!","We are international businessmen..."
"Sir! Lower your voice or we'll restrain you.","Dude, seriously, relax."
"We at least get to call our lawyer.","Exactly! We have a lawyer?"
"You had to play the race card.","Relax, Ted. We didn't do anything wrong. And, B.T.W, we'd be out of here by now if you'd have tucked in your shirt."
"No, we can't just... we're going home!","We're going to Sascha's?"
"Who the hell is Sascha?","Sascha. She's having friends over for drinks at her house. It's goanna be legen... wait for it...and I hope you're not lactose intolerant 'cuz the second half of that word is... dairy."
"Hello.","Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law."
"No, we're not.","Yes, we are."
"Shh!","Philly!"
"I do okay.","Wow it must be really well cornered off over there. You ever go behind the rope and touch it?"
"Only all the time.","Ever, like, stick your head inside it?"
"Yeah.","Hi Nora. Thank you for reminding me. The reason I'm calling..."
"Nope, I have never licked it.","Hmm... I bet nobody in history has ever licked the Liberty Bell! If someone were to pull that off I dare say it would be... what's the word?"
"Well, this is my stop.","Legendary, Ted, LEGENDARY!"
"We're going to the airport.","Bong, bong..."
"Why do I hang out with you? Why? All I wanted was to have a regular beer, in a regular bar with my regular friends, in my regular city!","Ted, Ted... you're not even looking."
"No, I'm not.","Look, our forefathers died for the pursuit of happiness, okay. Not for the sit around and wait of happiness. Now if you want, you can go to the same bar, drink the same beer talk to the same people everyday, or you can lick the Liberty Bell! You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it!"
"That was beautiful, man!","Thanks, Leonard. Ted, you're missing out on a valuable life lesson!"
"Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okay. I know how to live. If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell just go lick it yourself.","No, it has to be the two of us."
"Why? Why do you need me?","Because, you're my best friend, alright? You don't have to tell me I'm yours. But the way I see it, we're a team. Without you, I'm just the dynamic uno. You know what, fine. If you wanna go home... then we'll go home."
"Fine...we'll go lick the Liberty Bell!","Good,"
"That's the crazy part. I've had this shirt for, like, six years... Until this morning I wasn't into it at all, but now it's like my tastes have changed.","Booger."
"Barney's offering me fifty bucks to say some stupid word on a live news report.","Not some stupid word, ""Booger""."
"But I'm not doing it, I am a journalist.","What? Journalist? You do the little fluff pieces at the end of the news. Old people, babies, monkeys... that's not journalism, that's just things in a diaper."
"So I'm not going to jeopardize my promotion by saying ""Booger"" for fifty bucks.","Of course not, because now you're saying ""Nipple"" and it's a hundred! Step into my web."
"Not Goonies, girls. What if there's someone from my past, who I thought was wrong for me at the time, but in fact she, like my shirt, is actually a perfect fit?","Hold up, there are only two reasons to date a girl you've already dated. Breast, Implants."
"I just wasn't looking for a big commitment at the time, of course now a big commitment doesn't seem so bad... maybe I should call her? What do you guys think?","You dumped a p*rn star? Friendship over FRIENDSHIP OVER!"
"At least it's better than booger. Booger.","There she is. Hey is it cold in here, because I can kind of see Robin's nickels? Now for your next challenge..."
"No, there is not going to be another challenge, I don't care how much you offer me.","Oh, search your soul, Robin. You and I both know this wasn't about the money. Sure, Metro News One pays you jack and hey, a little green salad on the side's good for you, me and Mr. McGee."
"Seriously, who talks like that?","Well baby really likes, is the thrill of pulling one over on those bean counters, who under appreciate you and still haven't promoted you. And for two more hundy-sticks, baby's going to look in the camera and say this"
"I don't know!","Did you sleep with her sister?"
"Thank you.","Amateurs."
"That was me then, okay? This is the new old shirt-wearing, sack-having Ted. I'm gonna make this right.","You know what else? My younger sister just got married and I'm about to turn thirty-sex. Fantastic."
"I have no idea. Some kind of yoga?","You know, that Natalie... she's good times."
"Ineffable... good word. So when are you going to do it?","She's probably on the subway by now. You could call her Voice Mail. Beep, dumped. Click. Done!"
"No, no. We're going to get you out of this. Okay, how about... ""It's not you it's me""?","Mm... Mm! Six words! You... look... fat... in... those... jeans..., you're free to go."
"Ted, have you considered telling her the truth?","Seriously, honey, men are working, here."
"Want to talk mature? I just wrapped up a live newscast by honking my own boobs.","And great TV was had by all. Alright Scherbatsky, new challenge. And this one's big. But so, is the cash reward. For one thousand dollars, you heard me, all you have to do is get up there on the news and do one of these..."
"The Ickey Shuffle.","And as you do it, you say this, ""Elbert Ickey Woods. The bangles were fools to cut you in '91. Your 1521 rushing yards and your 27 touch downs will not be forgotten. So Coach Dave Shullah, screw you and your crappy steakhouse."""
"Well...","Page 4..."
"Oh, boy, here we go.","Everyone, everyone... If I may direct your attention to the television. You're about to see something... amazing."
"And them, in '72, Mickey Mantle rode my cab for the fourth time.","Come on, baby... bring it home."
"You planned that?","No, Marshall. That was beyond my wildest dreams"
"It's in my hair!","But isn't it nice to know that people are watching?"
"I'm bleeding internally.","Hey, Ted, you know what always picks me up when I'm down? Other people's misfortune. You missed something so amazing."
"Please can we please have one person in this whole bar who didn't see it?","Fine."
"Because tonight, I am getting us all into ""Okay"".","""Okay""!? Awesome!!"
"What's going on, did I just have a stroke?","""Okay"" is the name of a club. Yeah, it's supposed to be incredibly exclusive. This friend of mine once waited outside for two hours, he couldn't get in."
"A friend of yours named you?","No... a friend of mine named, shut up."
"He's even getting me into the VIP room.","Yeah, he just wants to show you his own VIP if you know what I mean..."
"Okay, what does ""VIP"" stand for in your universe?",".. I know that the ""P"" is penis."
"Ever since then she's been signing him up for book clubs, cooking classes...","All the things you do when you know where the next ten thousand lays are coming from."
"Oh, you are gonna love Kelly. She's fun, she's smart, she lives in the moment.","Translation, she's ugly, she's ugly, she ugs in the ugly."
"Okay, I guess I can take her off your hands for an evening.","So, do you have any other hot single fr..."
"Hey we're wearing the same shirt! Oh, wait no that's just my shirt reflected in yours.","One of the twenty-four similarities between girls and fish is that they're both attracted to shiny objects. You really never read my blog, do you?"
"Alright, well, have fun at your little disco, guys.","What the hell happened to these two?"
"Yeah, it's going to be sweet, too. Like tonight we're tasting all these different wines, pairing them up with these cool gourmet cheeses...","Wow, who knew being committed in a heterosexual relationship could make a guy so gay."
"Do strategies ever work for you?","Question is: do these strategies ever not work for me? Either way the answer's ""about half the time""."
"Whoa... this place in lourd!","You think?"
"You think?","Okay, it's a little loud."
"I'm bailing, see ya.","Oh hey, I can't see her face. Is she hot?"
"..any aspirin?","Maybe theres..."
"Maybe theres...","a machine in..."
"a machine in...","The restroom."
"Barney.","Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste."
"What? What happened to that, uh, cutlet you were grinding with?","That was my cousin, Leslie."
"What?!","You heard me."
"Hey. Thanks for saving my night. I'll talk to you soon? Umm, hey... tip her, Barney.","Why, I didn't check a coat. And even if I did, on principle tip jars have become so..."
"Funny story, Barney was grinding with this girl all night...","FINE! Just... eh."
"I'M SORRY, I JUST ASSUMMED YOU...","THEY PLAYED SOME GOOD SONGS TONIGHT."
"I KNOW, I KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SUDDENLY WE'RE LIVING IN TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS. MAYBE YOU'VE GOT MORE IN COMMON WITH BARNEY.","WHAT?"
"PROBLEM IS... YOU CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT COUPLE STUFF UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO DO IT WITH. AND THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO FIND THAT SOMEONE IS BY GOING OUT DOING STUPID SINGLE STUFF WITH BARNEY.","WHAT?"
"YOU KNOW, TED, I DON'T SAY THIS NEARLY ENOUGH BUT REALLY...","THAT PLACE MAKES GREAT SALADS!"
"I know, I'm still shaking.","What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold."
"But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae","Marshall ran away from a cockroach."
"It, it was a mouse.","Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man."
"BAR","Was that chick at the end really a client?"
"Yes.","What..."
"What?","You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous."
"Oh my God.","Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock."
"(Ted sitting on couch reading magazine, Ted hears squeaking and tiny footstep noises, Barney barges into the apartment_","Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking."
"Your boat is sinking. That was good.","Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again."
"All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step.","Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless sex."
"You deserve more.","That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we."
"Oh, of course you can. That is so...","It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her?"
"Get out.","Why, am I under arrest?"
"I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again.","Oh my God, people do that."
"You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way?","What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?"
"That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.","OK, Ted, let's go."
"You're cute. You're an architect. Good career and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application like your friend, Jack Package.","It's pronounced 'Pa-kojj.'"
"OK, it's back and this time we got a good look.","Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that."
"Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over.","So did you get a good look at it?"
"It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know...","Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?"
"Did you just use my name as a verb?","Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out: to overthink. Also see Ted-up. Ted-up: to overthink something with disastrous results. Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when"
"She wants to have two children. Her guilty pleasure song is Summer Breeze by Seals and Croft.","Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman."
"OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.","You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny."
"Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.","Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game."
"Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien. About today, listen, I really need to talk to you. Call me, I'll be at the office all day.","The doctor will see you now."
"In that scenario, I'm not interfering, I'm a happy ending.","Happy ending."
"Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a sh*t.","All right, see you later. Happy hunting."
"Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse.","Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles."
"INT. BAR","Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O."
"And why is that girl checking you out?","Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged"
"Yeah, so?","So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?"
"Dammit Past Ted","You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out."
"One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.","Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment."
"Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?","Sort of on a date with her."
"Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.","Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck."
"Ooh, can I do it?","Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy."
"Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy.","Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?"
"Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.","An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy."
"An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.","Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?"
"Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.","Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there."
"Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there.","See you guys later."
"They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.","Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one."
"One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.","Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike."
"Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?","You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big."
"What, like buy a new sofa?","Bigger."
"Bigger.","Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law."
"A lemon law, like for cars.","Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now."
"Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now.","Hi Katie. Barney."
"Hi, it's good to finally meet you.","Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history."
"Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.","Tell your friends."
"Tell your friends.","It's gonna be a thing."
"You're a jerk.","No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing!"
"For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.","No, wrong, lemon law is awesome."
"It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.","OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy."
"OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy.","You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?"
"Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.","Bad move, Scherbatsky."
"Bad move, Scherbatsky.","Hi, have you met Robin?"
"Leave me alone.","4:56, 4:57, 4:58."
"We're only just getting to know each other.","Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital."
"They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine.","So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie."
"So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie.","What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie."
"INT. HOSPITAL WAITNG ROOM","It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law."
"Here here. Cheers","And to the lemon law."
"And to the lemon law.","Self-clink."
"Not how much? What.","The Thankstini. A fun and delicious new novelty drink I invented. Cranberry juice, potato vodka and a bouillon cube. Tastes just like a turkey dinner."
"No, Barney's got his own Thanksgiving tradition.","Thanksgiving in a strip club, who's in? The Lusty Leopard has a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet. Plus, they do this thing. Heather dresses up as a pilgrim and Misty dresses up as an Indian, and they share a meal."
"Oh, Barney.","I'm sorry, Native American."
"Yeah, I thought I'd just spend the day giving back, you know, doing some good.","Canceling out Barney."
"I know. I'm so psyched we did this. Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man. These have got to be the best people in New York.","Excuse me, guys. Coming through."
"Barney?","Well, hi guys."
"What are you doing here?","Oh, just the Lord's work."
"But you're Satan.","Guys, OK, look, I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here. I think it's important to help the less fortunate. I'm the Angelina Jolie of incredibly hot guys."
"Barney, we need you out front. There is a logjam on the stuffing line. Can you show them how it's done?","I'm on it."
"Every Sunday, all year long. He's our best volunteer","That's because I was trained by the best, Kendall."
"Come on, we just wanna help out.","Kendall, they're cool."
"Fine, but I'm not promising anything. Wait here, we'll let you know if we need you.","OK, well, I better get out there. There's a lot of food to give out. And a lot of smiles."
"INT. HOMELESS SHELTER KITCHEN","So, wait, not only have you not done any good for anyone today, you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know, Ted, it's called Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking. Damn."
"Hey, Barn? What do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit?","You wanna scoop stuffing your first day out? Hello, NFL, can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude."
"Barney, you need me to sign your time sheet, right?","Yeah, Right. Thanks."
"You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet.","Yeah, so."
"All right, let me see that.","That's my private personal business!"
"Oh my God, you're on probation? What did you do?","That's my private personal business."
"That's my private personal business.","I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church."
"You peed on a church?","I peed in an alley which happened to have a church which I did not see because I was drunk."
"Now, all's right with the world again.","OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW."
"OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW.","When's the last time either of you did any good? Huh?"
"Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.","I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip."
"I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.","Volunteer of the year!"
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it.","Ted, I'm glad you asked."
"Surprisingly good.","Right? I told you so."
"You wanna know why I have to work tomorrow? My firm's designing an executive lounge for a tobacco company. In the fight against cancer, I'm on the side of cancer.","OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance."
"Are you joking?","I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment."
"No, I'm stuffed. Just a lap dance would be fine.","Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners. You know where he hasn't been? To heaven with Samantha. Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need. Now buy this man a lap dance."
"I hope not.","No, no."
"OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?","That's ridiculous."
"$1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger.","You gonna put out?"
"You gonna put out?","What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills."
"OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for...","What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go."
"Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?","Daddy's home."
"Daddy's home?","Yeah."
"You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Barney.","Hm. Yeah, I think it's pretty solid."
"Oh, daddy's back. See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that...","Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh?"
"That worked. I hate the world.","Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do."
"Doo-doo.","Totally."
"So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped.","Oh yes it can."
"Interesting","Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style."
"So, what? You want me to do a sh*t.","Oh no. I want you to do five shots."
"Barney, I think you've officially...","No, don't think. Do."
"Even alcohol cannot stop this brain.","I love it, I love it, I love it."
"Oh.","I don't like Chinese."
"Oh, bad idea.","No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober."
"You'll get this back at the end of class.","Ding, class dismissed. Here you go, kid, you call whoever you want."
"That girl in there is alive, right? Ted: I should call Barney, maybe he knows what happened.","Hello."
"Why are you sleeping in our tub?","The porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling."
"Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?","Don't worry, I slept through it. I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big t*nk."
"How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around one.","Oh, you put Ted to bed all right."
"I'm back baby doll!","Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now."
"Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now.","All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one?"
"I think....","Ehhh! Trick question, no thinking. You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride."
"Bring it.","Have you met Ted?"
"Excuse me.","You're calling Robin."
"I'm calling Robin.","Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her."
"Oh yeah? What you gonna do?","If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire."
"You set me on fire.","Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast. You got robbed, this is a blend."
"And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?","Who is she?"
"I have no idea.","Nice."
"You really don't know who that is?","No, after I hosed you down with a beverage g*n, I brought you back here."
"Barney, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar. Go into my stable and take my finest stallion. He's yours, his name is Windjammer.","Sleep it off, bra."
"Did you guys?","Oh come on. You've gotta give me this one. Those five shots got you farther with Robin than your brain ever did. See what happens when you don't think? You do! More importantly, you do Robin. Come on."
"Still, what does this mean? Are we dating now? I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it...","Someone get him a sh*t, he's thinking again."
"Wake her up and say what?","Daddy's home."
"I know, it's two years of my life I'm never getting back. A little part of me just wants to jump the bones of the next guy I see.","Daddy's home."
"Or the one after that.","OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy."
"OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy.","Ladies."
"Hey guys.","Robin."
"Hi Robin.","Top of the morning."
"I love to snack.","I'm good."
"Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?","Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah."
"Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah.","You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date."
"Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?","Ted, it's a simile."
"Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed.","Don't b*at yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you."
"I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck","What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way."
"Ah, here we go.","What?"
"A little girl?","What up?"
"Right. But I'm the bride, so I win.","Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years."
"Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?","Invigorating, thanks."
"I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy.","But to be fair, she's also hot."
"I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did.","Yeah, right."
"I did.","Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?"
"Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech.","Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move..."
"A little Barney.","A little Barney. And you know what he said? ""Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney."""
"INT. MACLAREN'S","OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch."
"Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up.","Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just... two vodka cranberries."
"You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.","Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?"
"Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?","They all drink vodka cranberries."
"They all drink vodka cranberries.","So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?"
"You got $400,000?","No, but I do have a hug."
"No, but I do have a hug.","Thank you."
"Maybe we got together too young. Maybe that's what the problem was. I mean, I'm 28 years old. I've really only been with one man.","That's just, that's... two more vodka cranberries please."
"That's just, that's... two more vodka cranberries please.","Claudia, it's all gonna be OK."
"Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me.","Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle."
"Oh, hell no.","Oww"
"Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes.","Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each."
"Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each.","All right, all right."
"Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break.","Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen."
"What's a sixteen?","Those two eight's right over there. Yeah."
"Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.","Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids."
"I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.","Being single's the best."
"Stay out as late as you want.","Answer to no one."
"The whole world full of endless possibilities.","Never having to go to a farmer's market."
"Never having to go to a farmer's market.","OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me..."
"Wow, the Peace Corps?","Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, ""Is it?"" And usually they say, ""yes it is."""
"Barney, they are so right. I wish there was something I could do.","Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that."
"Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...","Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted."
"INT. MASSAGE PARLOR","This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?"
"Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?","You know I did."
"Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.","You know I won't."
"Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.","Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night."
"OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.","Really? Ted: Yeah."
"Really? Ted: Yeah.","But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing."
"I'm ready to be proven wrong.","Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial."
"Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial.","Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on."
"Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.","What kind of shoes..."
"What kind of shoes...","Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing."
"Actually.","Oh come on."
"Whoa. There she goes.","Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them."
"Yeah, they do sound cute. Any idea who...? OK, well thanks anyway. Yeah, you take... Tonight? Well, I'm shipping out pretty early so I won't be able to stay over, but, yeah, sure, I'd love to. OK, I'll talk to you later.","Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight."
"And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for sex.","I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately."
"Going. Getting.","Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up!"
"Yes! No.","Oh come on!"
"Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.","Ted, you still with us?"
"And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be...","The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot."
"Yup.","Hanging out at a coffee place is not nearly as much fun as hanging out at a bar."
"That cute coffee girl wrote a heart by your name. Somebody has a crush on you.","Somebody thinks you're me."
"Mine says ""Ted,"" no heart.","Mine says... ""Swarley."" How'd they get ""Swarley"" from ""Barney""? It's not even a name. Who would ever be called ""Swarley""? Oh, please don't start calling me ""Swarley."" This would never happen at a bar!"
"Hey, dude, by the way, I really like that suit. Tell me about the fabric. Is it foreign or something?","Wow. It is foreign. I'm impressed, Ted. It's Moroccan, actually."
"I got a call for Swarley. Is there a Swarley here?","You weren't interested in my suit at all, were you?"
"Geez, can't you hear him, Swarley? There's a call for you.","Stop calling me that."
"It's right back there. Right? Right? She's hot! And she likes me? She likes Italian food. I also like Italian food. She likes Billy Joel. I also like... music. And I think we're going to go out again.","Dude, you gotta ditch her."
"Why?","If you go see them, it is not better than blondes showing their tits at a concert by Van Halen."
"What are you guys talking about, the crazy eyes?","It's a well-documented condition of the pupils, or pupi."
"No. Just pupils.","It's an indicator of future mental instability."
"You just can't see it because you're afflicted with ""haven't been laid in a while"" blindness.","She was too far away in the coffee place, but when I saw her up close just now..."
"Guys, I'm not going to stop dating Chloe just because you think she has the crazy eyes.","You can keep going out with her, but you're gonna regret it. One time, I met a girl at this very bar. I saw that she had the crazy eyes... But I ignored it. And then, sure enough."
"Barney, can I ask you a question?","Anything."
"Would you like to have a threesome?","Of course."
"So, did you do it?","No. It ended up being just a twosome with the third one watching from a chair."
"Which one were you?","I'd rather not say."
"So, she's needy crazy. That's one of the worst kinds.","I've had one of those. Makes up stories to get attention. Went out with her for three weeks, her dad died twice."
"Guys, she was really freaked out, okay? Maybe the story is true.","What in the world would make you believe that's a true story?"
"She's really hot.","They always are."
"What's up Swarlz?","No. Okay? No. No more. I will not let this become a thing. It's over. No more Swarley. No Swarlz. No more Swar-lay. No more Swar... wait for it... ley. No more Bob Swarley, man. No more. No! It's over. Do you understand?"
"Oh. For his date. Good for him. Hope he has a good time tonight.","Relax, you've got nothing to worry about. The girl's crazy."
"Thanks!","He'll just have wild monkey sex with her five times, max, and be done with her."
"Thanks again.","What are you doing?"
"And this next one's going out to Swarley. All your friends know you miss Barney, but he's gone, and you got to accept that, baby. And, Swarley, you're gonna be  a better woman for it. Here's ""I Am Woman"" by Helen Reddy.","Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman. I love it! You know, I was thinking about this whole new name thing last night, and you know what I realized? I like it."
"You like being called Swarley?","Are you kidding? I want you to call me that."
"Do you really think this is gonna work?","Do I think what's gonna work? I'm just saying, I love my new name, so please only call me that from now on."
"Call you what?","You know, that-that-that new name that you've been calling me."
"Say it.","Why? You guys know what it is."
"Say the name.","No, I don't want to! I hate it! I hate it! It's not funny! It's never been funny! I've never done any... No!"
"Okay, I ran it by the group, and we decided we're gonna give you a choice. We will agree to stop calling you Swarley, but instead, we'll call you Jennifer. Well?","I'm thinking. How about this? On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, you..."
"It's nice to meet you, Roland. I'll see you guys later.","Roland? Your name's Roland. That's funny, right? Rock and Roland. Warsaw is the capital of what? Roland. You're Monica Roland-ski. Hey, yeah, that's just how I Roland."
"Nice try, Swarley.","Damn it."
"In a corridor, on a bench.","Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen."
"Casino.","Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it."
"Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?","Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either."
"No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.","Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are."
"Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.","Come on, let's go."
"All right, I'm in.","To the Willowbrook Mall!"
"No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.","Why not?"
"What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?","Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment."
"The 'oh' moment?","Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker."
"It's a promise ring. I made a pact with God to stay a virgin till I'm married.","Oh."
"I don't have an eating disorder. It's just when I put food in my mouth, I chew it and then I spit it out.","Oh."
"I just turned 30.","Oh."
"Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.","You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox."
"It's true. They tell each other everything.","I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you"
"Try me.","Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?"
"Doggie ate his pants. Yep.","Bill's bachelor party in Memphis."
"Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?","OK, Seattle."
"Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch.","Damn."
"Yeah, meanwhile, Robin tells me nothing.","Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?"
"You know?","Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p*rn, wait for it, ography."
"My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.","They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess."
"Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted.","Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it."
"Thank you Barney.","'Cause it's p*rn."
"Robin is not in p*rn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.","20,000 says it's p*rn."
"I don't have 20,000.","Well then, what do you have?"
"See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?","I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress."
"I can see my hand print on your face.","Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of p*rn from Canada I have to go through."
"I won the bet. Why are you still searching?","Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong."
"Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p*rn.","Canadian p*rn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go ""oat"" of my mind."
"You told him? Lily: I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you.","Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk."
"One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.","Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall: No. You're gonna cry."
"I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.","So I just got a very interesting phone call."
"What are you talking about?","I wanted to be your father!"
"That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now.","Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this."
"Yeah. No I don't.","What?"
"Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.","Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!"
"Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!","Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing."
"Barney, don't, okay.","Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right."
"I wanna stress that I was young.","Yeah you were."
"And I didn't know any better.","They never do."
"And it started out as an innocent modeling job.","It always does."
"Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.","I'm gonna go with the five for eternity."
"So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?","Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket."
"Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today!","Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin: Yes."
"my eyes are up here.","Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?"
"I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready.","When will you be ready?"
"I grew my breakup beard.","Ted Mosby, suit up, 'cause here's the plan. There's a Miss Nassau County pageant. We'll pretend to be judges and, yes, our votes are for sale."
"I repainted the apartment.","Finish line of a woman 10K. Salty girls on an endorphin high who just want to lie down. Yeah."
"And the truth is, I was doing really good.","Female acrobats from Montreal. Super flexible. We're going to get ""Cirque de So-Laid"". What up?"
"That's my wife.","Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name?"
"Gael.","Kyle?"
"What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.","That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner."
"Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time.","How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me."
"How do you know?","And you never thought to say?"
"To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian.","This conversation never happened."
"All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing.","Yes!"
"""I just want to make sure you're okay with this""? Damn it! I can't believe she's the one that gest to say that. She's winning, isn't she?","Hum-hum. Not for long. Okay, pep talk. Take a knee. Ted, tonight, we're going to get you someone way hotter than Robin. Okay, Robin's a ten. Fine we'll get you a 12. Or, you know... two sixes. Failing that, four threes. And break glass in case of emergency we'll go the Staten Island, I'll get you 12 ones. Ted, my boy, I'm going to re-teach you... Ah."
"Ted.","Are you a total idiot, Ted?"
"What?!!","Let's bail, this place is dead."
"Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out.","Yes, exactly, plus, we're on a tight schedule. I've got the entire evening perfectly planned out... Spoiler alert: Our last stop is an after hours club so after hours, it's three days from now. What up?"
"Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning.","Yeah. But I didn't get to help."
"So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her?","Apology accepted. Let's go."
"Hum. This is Barney. Barney, Amy.","I'm not gonna remember that. Now, if you'll excuse me, random chick from earlier tonight, as you shall henceforth be known. Ted and I have a schedule to keep."
"Oh, well. You can check out off 08:54, dress up like a dork and bother the cool kids. b*at it, nerd.","Wow. Wow. Great stuff, Tommy Lee. See what you don't understand is, I'm Ted wingman. It's a sacred bond, much stronger that any... They're making out again!"
"The night was doing great. Amy was cool and dangerous. She found a friend for Barney. She even paid for drinks... sort of.","They know us here! You're gonna get us in trouble."
"Tell me something. Do you ask your tailor to leave extra room in the crotch for your huge vagina?","You... your vagina... Ted, this chick is crazy. We're leaving."
"Good idea. Let's all go back to my place.","Your place? Thanks, but no thanks, 1994 Courtney Love."
"Oh, thanks. You should get one.","Wrong. Ted has a classic clean-cut look that never goes out of style season after season, burn."
"Yeah? Well. I think he would look hot with some ink.","No, he wouldn't."
"Yes, he would.","No, he wouldn't."
"Yuh-huh.","Nuh-uh."
"I'm ready to do anything you want by the way. Anything. Right now.","Ted. Who are you gonna side with on this tattoos thing?"
"Sorry. I used to nanny for those jerks before they fired me. So unfair.","Unfair? I wouldn't let you take care of the imaginary kids I make up to score with single moms. That's it Ted, we're going home. Ted? Ted, you okay?"
"I'm okay. In fact, here's how okay I am. I'm gettin' a tattoo.","You're not getting a tattoo. It's not you. Ted, you are heading down a dark path."
"That dark path is my driveway.","But you need a plan and you need a wingman!"
"But you need a plan and you need a wingman!","This is so going in my blog!"
"Want to have sex?","Okay."
"Hum. Really, never? Not even if, say, butterflies flew out of his ass?","What?"
"Hum. Hum. What?","Ted?"
"Hmm?","I came here this morning because... I want to apologize."
"Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter.","See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now."
"Hmm.","Since you and Robin split, you've been gestating. Growing in your cocoon. And last night... you burst out of that cocoon..., like a majestic, uh... gosh, what is it that comes out of a cocoon? I was always bad at science."
"A butterfly? What?","Nothing, buddy."
"Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God! I have a tattoo.","Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp."
"Tramp stamp?","You know, a ho tat. Ass antlers. A Panama City license plate."
"No no no no no no no. Give me this.","Oh, yeah, that'll get it out."
"Kids, I can't remember exactly what helped me get through the whole Robin-Gael incident. I'm sure it was something profound and meaningful and not at all macho and petty. But after that, I was back on my feet. And what followed was a new era in my life. A crazy time unlike anything that came before. It's funny looking back on those days, knowing now exactly what I was heading towards, and what was heading towards me.","Go for Barney."
"Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something.","What is it?"
"Just a new website. Slapcountdown.com.","What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?"
"What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?","No. No!"
"It's the same. Mostly, except I think I might be getting carpal tunnel. My hands keeps cramping up.","I think the whole point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that anymore."
"Yeah. You're writing constantly. There's forms we have to sign, our death folders, thank you notes...","Whoa. Whoa. What are death folders?"
"I am such a jerk.","Yeah. Wait, why?"
"Number six. Yeah. Oh, God, I am a bad husband. No, uh, no, I'll just write, I'll write Lily a letter tonight, everything'll be fine.","That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen."
"Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter.","No way at all. In fact, I dare God to smite down this perfectly healthy..."
"And here I am at the drum circle.","Whoa. Are you topless? Ted, check this out."
"Wow. There's a lot of nude people in here.","You haven't changed, Scherbatsky. You're a sophisticated, scotch-swilling, cigar-smoking, red-meat-eating, g*n new yorker."
"Just shoes and a shirt. That's a look.","What you are not is a massage-giving, windsurfing, bongo-playing, teetotaling, vegan, peacenik, hippy like you soon to be ex-boyfriend, Gael. Back me up here, Ted."
"I'm evolved, and I'm enjoying living my life a little bit closer to the way Gael and I did in Argentina.","Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a ""Best if banged by"" sticker on him. Once your romance starts to stink, you'll dump his ass down the drain like sour milk and go back to being ""Unevolved Robin"", the one we actually like. Back me up here, Ted."
"I'm just happy Robin's happy.","I'm telling you, within three days..."
"Ooh, here he comes. Switched to big words.","Within a triad of solar periods, you'll recognize your dearth of compatibility with your paramour and conclude your association."
"What are we talking of? Baseball?","This is all gonna returns to masticate you in the gluteals. Support my hypotehesis, Ted."
"My windsurfing board... it had floated away. And the shark... he was getting closer. They say to escape you punch a shark in the nose. But I said... ""Brother shark, we are both children from the same earth mother."" And that's all I remember until the hospital.","That guy..."
"Yeah. That guy. Look at how easy he has it.","Well. You and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. But that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. And why?"
"He's better looking than us.","No. Because he's from out of town."
"Yeah. Plus a*t*matic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. God, I wish we were tourists.","Yeah. Actually... You know where I've been meaning to visit?"
"Okay, okay. We're from a small town in the south of France. Our plane leaves sunday morning.","Uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies. Hate to bother you. We seem to be a little bit lost. Would you happen to know which street the statue of liberty's on?"
"Hi, um, I'm Colleen.","Hi, Colleen."
"This is Lindsay.","Hi, Lindsay."
"Well, it's just we're leaving sunday morning. It sure would be nice to have some real New Yorkers show us around.","Yeah."
"Well. We're tonight, but... maybe tomorrow afternoon? Atfer lunch?","Well. Hotdog! Should we... you want to just meet here in front of Mac... MacLaren's pub?"
"We'll see you tomorrow.","All right."
"'m just saying it seems like a kind of bar a lot of cool people would hang out there.","Okay. All right."
"I'm gonna go, too.","This is the easiest date ever. You know what I'm gonna try next? A knock, knock joke."
"Easiest? Somehow we have managed to find the two lamest new yorkers of all time.","Ted, Ted, Ted. Dude."
"I'm looking at you. What?","Right. Stay with me. We are on the cusp of moving from out-of-towners to in-their-pantsers. Ay-o?"
"All right, Ignatius, one more hour.","Nice. Nice. Hey, nice."
"Hey. Our friends invited us to a party. You guys want to come along?","Knock, knock."
"Who's there?","Yes, we do."
"Hey. If we're going north, why did we cross over the FDR? We should have taken the Hudson.",""
"A hundred... on the south of Bronx at this time of night? We're going to get k*ll.","Ted. I think these local new yorkers know more about the city than we do, so relax. We're in very capable hands."
"There were three of them, at least two g*n... they took all our money.","Well. I only had traveler's checks."
"You're the best. And maybe a couple polaroids?","What?! This night couldn't have gone any better. We've just survived a mugging. You know what that means."
"""Thank God, we're alive"" sex.","""Thank God we're alive"" sex. It's even better than ""I can't believe you just proposed to me"" sex, which I've only had, like, four of five times. Ted, please, we are so close."
"Yeah. I just want to celebrate the fact that we survived. You know?","Mmm-mm. Me too. So where do you live?"
"You guys live in New Jersey, not New York?","Theodore."
"New Jersey?","Teddy?"
"Oh, no. Oh, no.","Oh, no."
"Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to ""pretty much New York""? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!","You're not from Missouri? Well, I will be a monkey's unc..."
"Ew. Can we get a ride?","Hey, um, sir, can we get ride, too?"
"Oh, good to be back. Although it's weird, vacation Robin popped into my dream again last night.","Listening."
"Oh my God. Barney...oh my God.","Use your words, Ted."
"OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.","The belt?"
"The belt.","But that's impossible. You were up here less than half an hour ago."
"Yes, advantage Ericksen.","Don't get cocky. Wimbledon lasts a fortnight."
"What? We agreed, I suited up.","You take too long to get ready"
"Yeah, which takes an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.","And then he starts on his hair. Ace."
"Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not?","Just go without us, we'll be there in five minutes."
"You just made the list, bitch.","So many questions. Firstly, what do you think would happen if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots?"
"Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've g*n a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave.","FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough."
"Shekwakie.","Stinson."
"All right, the beers are here.","Yeah, we're not gonna make it."
"Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off?","Yeah, pants are off."
"Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean.","That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set."
"That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.","Stinson."
"I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident.","You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the fire escape."
"I think the new girl's kinda into me.","So you now have two on the line?"
"And I don't know which one to go for.","Go for the new girl."
"Go for the new girl.","Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove."
"New girl? What new girl?","Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think..."
"I thought we were in for the evening.","That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor."
"It's a tricycle.","No way, no way, no way!"
"Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts.","Put him on speaker."
"Put him on speaker.","So what you're saying to us right now is you have a sh*t at the belt?"
"You actually bought a belt.","That's right, it's resplendent."
"It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around.","I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well..."
"Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?","All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?"
"What? No.","Ted?"
"INT. APARTMENT","Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me. We're combing upsars."
"What are you doing?","I repeat. I will say that it happened to me to lie on compassion."
"Why, why?","Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom."
"But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting.","I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close."
"I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.","So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?"
"OK.","Ay ay ay."
"Get out!","You must come to Brazzaville, in New Jersey to take me out."
"(Ted checks out his hair in the mirror, steps towards the door, steps back to mirror and touches up his hair again, steps towards the door, steps back to mirror and continues to touch up his hair","Oh my God."
"Ted, you're ruining this for everyone.","Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors sh**t themselves in the foot."
"So, Barney, why don't we take this party to a more horizontal location?","Oh no, the night's ruined!"
"No, baby, it's not.","Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?"
"Why would you do that to yourself?","Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me."
"See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?","The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn."
"It won't?","No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong. Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1."
"Why would I want to tire them out?","That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one."
"OK, what the hell.","OK, wait for it."
"Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.","Yes you can."
"So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it.","What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it."
"What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.","You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?"
"You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?","You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!"
"Some stories you tell, some stories you don't.","Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?"
"Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?","Ted, belt."
"Did you? Did you? Or didn't you?","Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?"
"What do you mean? Ted: When someone wants to set you up they always tell you the good qualities first but then they leave out their huge flaw.","She's totally hot and really fun."
"She's totally hot and really fun.","But she has a dead tooth."
"Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice.","If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it!"
"I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my vagina","g*n."
"You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays.","Nice."
"But she's a g*n nut.","But she's Canadian."
"But she didn't like Field of Dreams.","I can't think of anything."
"The ultimate ice breaker.","A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please."
"So, what are the eye patches for?","We got bit."
"Both of us.","They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up!"
"OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches.","Oh, Theodore..."
"Oh, Theodore...","..no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game."
"Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen.","Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner."
"Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.","Wow."
"I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes.","OK, Marshall."
"Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me.","What? Marshall: If dating is the game, then marriage is winning the game."
"You're joking. I have mad game, bra.","OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert."
"What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out.","Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list."
"Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl.","Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad."
"Fine.","And I only stirred that with my pinky."
"Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.","That's good too."
"That's good too.","How about her?"
"You're on.","Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?"
"Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars.","I win."
"How?","Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot."
"Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook.","I can't sleep with her again. She hates me."
"Get out of my way.","By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy."
"You see this. Game face.","Whatever, Ted."
"Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that?","Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song."
"I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have sex twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had sex a total of...wait for it...","Nice."
"One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had sex and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered.","Doesn't count."
"You're right, it counts. It counts as one. You've had sex once. How was it? Marshall: I still matter.","OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know."
"Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing.","We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak."
"We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak.","No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going on."
"Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?","Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic."
"What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped.","That's what you think happened."
"OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any...","Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend?"
"You are so sweet.","So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him."
"So you never slept with her?","Not even at all."
"Wow, that's good.","It gets better. Remember Ted's phone conversation?"
"Well., have fun in yoga","Well?"
"Well?","Oh."
"I'm sorry.","Stacy, right?"
"Yeah. Oh, you're Ted's friend from the bar?","Yeah, wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here too?"
"She plays bass in a reggae band.","I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae."
"Oh my gosh, I play in a reggae band.","No way, I wonder why Ted didn't tell me about that. Like I said, I'm a huge reggae fan."
"See you later alligator.","We are two peas."
"We are two peas.","Wow, take care. Namaste."
"You are a sociopath. That was my yoga mat.","So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing."
"Why? Parce que je le jeu me chienne.","Translation: 'cause I got game, bitches."
"No, no, this doesn't prove anything because...","Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy."
"Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy.","Hey, stace. What happened? He did not. Stay there, I'll be right over."
"Since Ted, you know, I don't really wanna get too physical too fast.","That's what makes you so special, baby."
"Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore.","So, she's hot."
"Oh, she's gorgeous.","Then she's crazy."
"No she's not.","Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes."
"OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me.","There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale."
"Wait, hot-crazy scale?","Let me illustrate."
"Let me illustrate.","A girl is allowed to be crazy..."
"A girl is allowed to be crazy...",".. as long as she is equally hot."
".. as long as she is equally hot.","Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot."
"Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.","If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot."
"If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.","You want the girl to be above this line"
"You want the girl to be above this line","Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head..."
"Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head...","..then lose ten pounds."
"..then lose ten pounds.","She'd stab me with a fork..."
"She'd stab me with a fork...",".. then get a boob job."
".. then get a boob job.","I should give her a call."
"OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class.","I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts..."
"She's not crazy.","OK, we'll see."
"Long story short, thank goodness I'm such a bad cook or I never would have met Ted.","It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy."
"No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No.","Really? Sixteen no's. Really?"
"Oh, I get it. Ted told you I didn't go to college so now you're giving me a cute little backhanded slap.","Oh, here we go."
"Well, while you were busy majoring in being freaking beautiful, I was starting my own line of handbags.","Your own line of handbags? That's crazy."
"You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please.","OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it."
"OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it.","Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died."
"Oh, I'm sorry about that.","No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh."
"Oh man, I'm really sorry.","Wow, you bought that?"
"Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney: Well played.","I like you Ted."
"I like you Ted.","Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live."
"Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.","Barney. We met at the urinal."
"Oh right, hi.","Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit."
"Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.","Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes."
"Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes.","Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward."
"Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward.","Edward, this is Audrey."
"Hi, my name is Audrey. Nice to meet you","He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like."
"I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.","What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time."
"Here. Call me.","And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever."
"He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.","Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online."
"OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.","Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?"
"(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});","Huh. Marshall and Lily are doing something meaningful. And it's making me less happy about this bonus. And I'm still single. At least I got that going for me. So why do I still feel outside of awesome looking in? What am I doing with my life?"
"Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.","She started the night here"
"She started the night here","But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone."
"But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.","Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to k*ll me with a brick."
"No, no no no no no no no no no no no.","How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times."
"How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times.","It was right over there."
"It was right over there.","Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you."
"This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass.","I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed."
"You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.","No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference."
"I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend.","Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her."
"Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her.","How much hotter is she than your girlfriend? Marshall: There's no comparison. What do you think, Ted? Go for it? Ted: Oh, don't do it, man. Think about Lily."
"You know what, I don't care. I've been with one woman for too long. I need me some strange.","Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger."
"Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger.","Poor guy's gonna crash and burn."
"Poor guy's gonna crash and burn.","That man is a god."
"For like a week after, Barney followed me around, asking me to teach him how to live. I even got him to do my laundry once.","I thought it was a Mr. Miyagi kind of thing."
"And I'm unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.","Worst superheroes ever."
"Another girl, Ted? Who haven't you made out with? You know what, I don't need this. I design handbags. I'm writing a memoir. I'm a superstar. This is totally my year. Someday the name Blah-blah will be up in lights. Ted, next time you're online playing World of Warcraft, don't even think about chatting with me.","World of Warcraft? The online role playing game? That's how you two met online?"
"I was working from home, because, you know, no distractions.","This is incredible!"
"Oh my God! I can't believe it!","I have big news!"
"Oh my God!","Okay. My thing's pretty huge. But fine, you can go first."
"Okay, I just found out...","I just find a porno starring Ted Mosby!"
"What are you... What you're talking about?","I'm talking about welcome to the sex plane, and look who plays the navigator, Ted Mosby"
"Oh my God. This totally explains the thing at my doctor's the other day.","All right. Let's meet your new doppelganger. Or should I say doppel banger."
"This is really bizarre. The only other famous Mosby I know was a confederate general during the civil w*r.","Probably not the same guy."
"Yeah, it really is.","Oh, hey, hey-o. New guy entering the cockpit. Could it be the navigator, Ted Mosby."
"Uh, no. No, navigators have three stripes on their hats. Captains have four. That guy's a captain.","Yeah, and I'm sure complete accuracy in all those details was very important to the directors... ""Dirt and skank, the raunch brothers""."
"Wow.","And I found a porno starring Ted Mosby."
"Oh my God, that's amazing!","I know, right?"
"Oh, congratulations, Marshall!","Congratulation for us all."
"Oh, let's go celebrate.","The fact that I found a porno starring a guy named Ted Mosby... Let's do it!"
"Apparently you can.","Ted, Ted, Ted, guy in the hat! Three stripes, ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ted Mosby, p*rn star."
"I know what kind of plane this is. It's a ""boing"".","See, this is way better than Marshall's intership."
"Oh yeah. A little bit. Yeah.","More around the eyes."
"Ah, ah, very funny, Wendy. Now we know you watch p*rn. This Ted Mosby must be getting kind of famous.","Hmm. You're not wrong. According to the web site, of the far superior Ted Mosby... he's been in the business three months, and he's made 125 movies."
"What do you mean?","Ted, as you know, I've always been really, really addicted to your mother."
"He is not trying to seduce me. He didn't even offer me the job.","That comes later. At dinner. He did invite you to dinner, didn't he?"
"Oh, you should go. I mean, you're not gonna take the job, but you might as well get a great meal out of the deal.","Don't wait up."
"Hmm. Wait, are you telling me that they actually have conventions for p*rn?","Affirmative. Or to put in another way... God bless America."
"Yeah i thought i was gonna get married to my last boyfriend but, boy, did that guy have commitment issues! That whole relationships, that 3 weeks of my life i'll never get back.","Well, I love commitment. I wish i could marry commitment."
"Really?","Yeah. I ate at the Tavern of vegetables, I started talking to the Swedish Top Model, and the next moment we batifolait in the back of a carriage. Go my beautiful, Hue!"
"You're talking about her boobs, right?","C! And that wasn't spanish, that was cup size! What up!"
"So these boobs...","Mmmm..."
"Paint me a word picture.","All right, Ted. Imagine the heads of two Irish babies. Let's call them...(bbllluuuuu) and"
"Well, clearly i wasn't!","Pay up! p*ssy!"
"Oh, they're on vacation in France for 2 weeks.","I see. Between you and me, i'm also interested in this apartment. So is there any way i could come back later and check it out while you'rte showing them other places?"
"Are you serious? You're trying to sneak this apartment away from Marshall and Lily?","Ted, do you think i have no morals whatsoever? I simply want to fool a girl into thinking this is my apartment so i can nail her once and never have to see her again. I'm not a monster!"
"This place is so nice.","Ah, make yourself at home. Please get comfortable. If you see something you like, just take it."
"Who are these people?","Ted, Marshall, Lily, Robin. I present to you Betty... my wife. And my son, Tyler."
"They're Asian.","Yeah! They're a chinese couple that wanted a white baby, it works both ways. Cookie?"
"Wow! Did you make those?","You got me. My sisters taught me how to bake and how to listen."
"Wow, i feel so at home here.","I'm glad. Sometimes, i don't. A place like this really needs a lady of the house. I know it's early to be thinking of you as... Oh, God, i'm freaking you out, aren't I? It's just you make me feel so safe. I didn't..."""
"Okay, let me get this straight. You just snuck this girl into some stranger's apartment?","Yeah, we spent the night."
"I'm wearing your bathrobe. I hope you don't mind.","The only thing missing from that bathrobe are your initials."
"My mom's gonna be in town next week. It's okay if she stays with us?","Only if she sleeps in the bed and i sleep on the couch."
"You're so sweet.","I love you. There, i said it and i'm not taking it back."
"Oh my god! I love you too. I'm finally not the first one to say it!","How about you get in the shower, and i will make us some waffles."
"Wait. That time that you offered to walk my dogs when i went to visit my dad in Vancouver...","Yup!"
"Is that why my Yorkie trembled for like a week after i got back?","Yeah. That little guy saw some stuff i'm not proud of."
"Ew, that was on the floor.","If you wwant to get to the bottom of this, you're gonna need a stronger stomach than that, doll face."
"(We see Lily jump on Marshall and kiss him) Which would mean....","What do you think, make obsess?"
"Nice catch, Robin.","I'll just, uh, take this down to the lab.."
"bup bup bup bup bup... Theres's only one possible conclusion. Lily and Marshall are fighting about peanut butter.","Ah!"
"I know what they were fighting about, and it wasn't peanut butter.","Robin, just..."
"I appreciate your help, but there's a reason your name is Robin, not Batman.","Just..."
"They were fighting because they didn't get the loan and it's all Lily's fault.","Robin, just..."
"This can't be happening.","They can't... get divorced."
"Yeah, it is. It's weird.","The world needs Marshall and Lily... together... I'm not crying, there's something in my eye."
"We have an annoucement.","I know, it's a terrible idea. You can't do it. Just look at me."
"Wow, guys! You scared us.","Oh, thank God. Cause, i mean, if you did then who'd be the lame married couple i get to make fun of? Like 'Hey Marshall, you're married mrs right, you just didn't know her first name was Always.' That stuff is cold."
"I have a tattoo!","oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp!"
"Dr Stella Zinman. She's the best in the business. And she's rather cute in fact. In fact... we're going to a movie together tonight.","what?"
"Ted, why would you do that?","what's matter with you?"
"What? What do you mean?","Dude... don't poop where you eat."
"and in this case, you're paying them... then yes, it counts.","You've heard of the golden rule, right? ""love their neighbor?"""
"uh, actually, it's ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" It's from the bible.","Damn it Ted, i've worked out this whole thing where the golden rule is ""love thy neighbor"", ok?... Now the golden rule is ""love thy neigbor"". But, there's one rule above it: the platinum rule: ""never ever, ever, ever, love thy neighbor."""
"Oh, yeah, and remember what happened with us and the gerards across the hall?","Need i remind you about me and Wendy the waitress?"
"yeah, i don't have time for this. I'm out the door as soon as i'm finished with my hair.","good, then we've got a solid half hour. And in that time, we will convince you not to set foot out that door. It's a story older than time, my friend, and it always plays out in the same eight steps. Step 1: Attraction."
"good, then we've got a solid half hour. And in that time, we will convince you not to set foot out that door. It's a story older than time, my friend, and it always plays out in the same eight steps. Step 1: Attraction.","It's true."
"That's not even possible.","12 of them."
"Here's your gin and tonic.","Thanks."
"Hockey.","The attraction is instant and undeniable."
"we're not gonna date them. We're just gonna be friends with them.","That's the couples version of dating."
"And you've got the couples version of the hots for them. Oh, yeah, you want to browse at pottery barn with them. You want to go antiquing with them, don't you? Oh, yeah, you want to antique the crap out of them.","Need i remind you what happened with me and Wendy the waitress?"
"No! Don't do it!","Request denied! What rule is there that say's i can't seduce the waitress at my favorite bar?"
"Yeah, with some sort of catchy name.","Well, i don't. I don't have one and i never will be because it's a great idea. Come on, guys! She's gullible. I'm bored. We're perfect for each other."
"Don't k*ll the bar, dude.","yeah, well... I think it'll be okay."
"We're just seeing a movie. If it seems at all weird, i'll back off.","That's what everyone thinks and then along comes step 3: Submission."
"That's what everyone thinks and then along comes step 3: Submission.","Good night!"
"Hey Barney! Carl had to take off. You mind giving me a hand?","Not at all."
"That was an intersting use of the beverage g*n.","Club soda can get anything off."
"It finally happened, all this time, every drink i brought you... I always felt there was this unspoken connection between us. And i was right!","hey, can i get a gin and tonic?"
"See, i bet you didn't pay for that gin and tonic.","oh, i paid for it."
"But you got to admit, there is an upside to breaking the platinum rule. Like maybe as her boyfrien, i could get a discount on treatments.","Oh, Ted, of course there's an upside. At first, that's step 4: Perks."
"we can split a cab to work together. We always have a standing lunch date. And last night, at the hockey game, Curt got us into the locker room, and i met Mason Raymond. Left wing for the Vancouver canucks.","What the opposite of name-dropping?"
"Come on people, get excited for us! We've got a great thing going here.","That's what i thought."
"Dude, you got to flick it.","you don't have..."
"Hi, sweetie. I had the kitchen whip these up, no charge.","Come on, guys, free nachos. What?"
"You're k*ll the bar.","I'm not k*ll the bar. Wendy the waitress has seen how i operate in this place. It is perfectly clear to everyone involved that this is nothing more than a temporary fling. It's fiiine."
"But it wasn't.","Which brings us to step 5: THE TIPPING POINT."
"on my suggestion, you...","hey, Wendy, uh, do me a favor and send a glass of champagne to that pretty young girl over there."
"Oh, okay, thanks sweetie.","okay. All right."
"Yeah, listen i'm leaving so if you want to write the rest of these down, i will read it tomorrow.","Don't do this Ted."
"Dude! ya! It was perfect! You're such a jerk!","Which brings us to step 6. You finally realize you've made a huge mistake and now you have to live with it. Step 6 is called purg... wait for it. Keep waiting. Keep waiting for the eternity only to dicover there's no escap-atory."
"Ro! we are such idiots!","Yeah!"
"""Hey neighbor!"" ""Hey, neighbor""""Hey neighbor.""","I remember that."
"We said ""don't do it!""","tss"
"You've got a whole meat locker at home full of corpses, don't you?","Now look at me. Declawed. Neutered. What was once my jungle is now my zoo and i am forced to mate with the same old lioness again, and again, and again while families pay to watch."
"yeah, this metaphor's really falling apart.","Put a bell around my neck and scratch my belly kids, for i am just a docile housecat now. Miaou!"
"We're getting a little sick of charades.","I mean, i don't like you that way. I used to like you that way but now that i've seen everything there is to see, i don't know, i kind of want to see those same parts just on other girls."
"Maybe we should just go back to being neighbors.","other girls and you, if you're into that but the other girls have to be there, too. That's the important part."
"Gosh, you're just terrified of ever getting close to anyone, aren't you?","or that. Let's say it's that. So can i get a gin and tonic?"
"Barney, i just want you to know, i have no hard feelings. It wasn't the best idea for us to get involved. I hope we can still be friends.","Thanks Wendy. Of course we can."
"waouh. I've got to hand it to Wendy the waitress that was very mature of her.","She's gonna try to k*ll me. This is poisoned."
"What? You're being ridiculous.","Yours is poisoned too. She's trying to k*ll me and everyone close to me."
"Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy so you don't have to face the far more likely possibility that she doesn't want to date you either?","Where did Marshall get that hamburger?"
"Dude.","You're welcome."
"Wait a second. You've been sitting here, pretending to be the expert on all this, but the truth is, this was no real fallout from your breakup at all?","Yet."
"All right, i'm taking off.","What?"
"You're such a jerk!","Ted, have you not been listening? Attraction, bargaining, submission, perks, tipping point, purgatory, confrontation, fallout! These things will all happen to you as surely as they happened to all of us! It's a rule of nature."
"Apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date Stella.","Exactly, the platinum rule. Stella reads my blog."
"On the house.","Thanks. Crazy!"
"Now kids, the spring of 2008 was a complicated time in your old man's life. The last time I had seen Barney was shortly after I found out he has spent the night with Robin.","Are you saying you don't wanna be bros anymore?"
"It's Barney. Dude, seriously you need to stop calling me.","Ted, I'm sorry, I haven't returned your calls."
"Yeah I never called you, you called me fifteen times and my parents twice.","I'm sorry, I gotta let you go. It's just too many good wingmen out there. Ted are you crying?"
"No I'm not.","Sh! Let it out, let it out."
"Hey Barney, new sky mall come in. So worldaround blog's fear is you are looking for a new wingman. I wanna let you know, I'm available. Just the say the word, or don't even say the word. Just do something with you eyebrow. Was that it?","No offence Randy, but there is a long list of candidats for this slot. This slot is for vice president of awesome. And you are like assistant under secretary of only ok."
"So uncle Barney began to search for a new wingman.","Pitt, Barney Stinson!"
"Hey! I haven't been calling you, it has been a while.","Yeah. Yeah. So, listen you should meet me in McLaren's tonight."
"You never gonna believe this. I'm at the hospital. Just had a baby daughter.","So what do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock?"
"So what do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock?","Starry Porten, Barney Stinson."
"What up, chef?","I need a new bro, what do you say?"
"Dude, I'do love to but now I'm bro with Duck Stan.","Oh, I understand. Duck Stan is a good bro. I'm happy for you. Best of luck."
"Oh, I understand. Duck Stan is a good bro. I'm happy for you. Best of luck.","Crazy Willie! Barney Stinson."
"What up B dog, long time no bro, so are we gonna tire it up tonight or what?","Yes finally!"
"Hello?","Robin, where are you?"
"What up bro-seph Lieberman?","No, uh-uh. Randy, we never use the word ""bro"" in the name of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate."
"Goodbye ""Geraldine Ferrar-bro"".","You know what? I'm excited about this, Randy. You will be my next masterpiece. It's like with Ted. When I first met him, he was an even bigger loser than you."
"What a loser.","But tonight, I'm going to make you the greatest wingman in the history of wingmen."
"Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro. Yeah. I've been reading your blog for years. You are like a God to me. That's why tonight is going to be legendary... wait for it... dary.","Oh, okay, Randy, let's do this."
"Ok.","You ready?"
"Yes. No, no, no, no, no, no!","What? What's the matter?"
"Nothing, let's do this. No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please! Just wait, just wait, just wait, just wait!","Randy what are you doing?"
"Dripping with game, that's what i'm doing. Okay let's go. No. Yes. No! Randy listen to me: you can do this okay? Ok. I don't know. Are thos girls really that hot? Yes, they're hot. Let's do this. Okay!",""
"At Ted and Marshall's apartment","Get this. You know who works out at my gym? Regis Philbin."
"Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank?","Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Took two months. Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal. Who wants a T-shirt? Hey, Marshall, they're hiring in the legal department. I could get you a job."
"We had sushi last night.","Italian."
"Indian?","I just said I don't like Chinese."
"Indian isn't Chinese.","Weird meats, funny music, side of rice. Why are we splitting hairs?"
"Mexican?","I just said I don't like Chinese."
"It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef k*ll it and ran it through the meat grinder.","I love this burger so much, I want to sew my ass shut."
"The tiniest little burger joint you ever saw, tucked between a taxidermist and a triple-X bookstore.","Name two places where things get stuffed."
"They laugh.","You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying."
"No. No, we don't know where it is.","I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!"
"I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!","OK, Regis, we will, we will."
"hat are you waiting for? Get out and find the burger!","All right."
"Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat.","You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment."
"Just shut up and eat.","All right."
"I think I just had my first burg-asm.","I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know?"
"Barney's phone rings. He answers.","Barney Stinson."
"Barney Stinson.","I'm sorry, this is...?"
"Regis. I'm at the place.","Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now."
"Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now.","Onions?"
"Onions?","Okay, no onions."
"They discover a Goliath National Bank ATM.","One of 9,000 convenient locations."
"Lily starting to hit Barney with her fits.","What the..."
"I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again. Goliath National Bank sucks. It's the worst bank on the face of the earth. Attention, New Yorkers, this bank sucks! They suck!","Marshall, Geez."
"They suck, suck!","Will you just tell her already?"
"Goliath National Bank. That's why Barney's been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is. He wanted you to be excited for me since we will to working together.","Well, technically not together. You won't have access to my floor."
"I haven't worked since March.","If only there were an easy, convenient way to get some cash right now."
"They all turn around face to the Goliath ATM.","Member FDIC."
"Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me.","This feels so good. I'm worried I'm gonna get this burger pregnant."
"Regis gets up.","That's outrageous."
"Barney comes dressed in a odd.","Well, I must go to Stella. Tonight is the big night. I tried before, I always failed. This time I will succeed. Tonight... I am a lesbian. Robin, your lipstick."
"Oh, no! Take pictures, okay?","Hi, Ted."
"Theodore!","T-Diddy! You've missed that!"
"It's pathetic. It's Saturday night. We should get drunk in a bar. I know this sounds depressing, almost tragic, but it is a fact.","Yeah, and I want another drink for this girl, Doris. I know I can ask this aircraft lesbian."
"With the next train, you can be in McClaren's to 23h.","You can be at 22h."
"That's great! We have darts. A half ping-pong. An aquarium. Look how it's getting a great night as planned. One could make the bait and watch them fight.","No thank you. I play not with aquariums unless they are my two favorite animals: the pilot fish and torturlute. Did you see!"
"For torturlute? You're right.","Marshall."
"You deserve better than that.","Lily."
"Not good enough.","Stella."
"Sorry.","I just said."
"Me too. My God, I moved to New Jersey?","Guys, I'm sure the dog had to soaring after swallowing the tablet X. Too good! Go!"
"It's not so bad. You can put a mini fridge, there, and perhaps an air hockey.","Air Hockey. Well done my fat."
"I understand why they want to live in New Jersey when you can live in Manhattan? I thought my apartment was one of his reasons for marrying me.","Seriously, I thought it was the only one. Too much!(Robin arrives in the basement) You're glowing. Tape the Barnacle."
"It was not my first day. I arrived and there were 20 people. In fact, I have not really got the job. I just had an interview.","How so?"
"That sucks, but I can do what? I will not have another job. You would have seen other women in the interview. They were all more experienced, more ""ethnic"". There was a black girl with blue eyes. How can I compete?","You can not."
"I called Joel.","If you call now, you'll regret it. I slept with me full of women who were then sent to graze and then decamped. And sometimes they take the phone and they call me and do it again. And when we finished, I see that look on their faces, that look that says they hate themselves and they would never have known. But if you could see this look... In fact, you can see that look, there is a video, http://www..."
"not Drink Beer! I remember when I bought it. That was before she became pregnant with Lucy. You can go pick on PriceCo? While you will be there, get yourself a map. You surely will go there all the time.","This is the look."
"Stella...","I'll give you $ 100 for hitting my fist. $ 200."
"Drop it, Barney. Your arm should make you suffer.","$ 10 000."
"It's the tears?","They are magnificent... manly tears of pain. They are not emotional. They are a little emotional."
"Shirley, this is Robin. I called Joel.","Robin, hangs up. Do not do that."
"You can never be in town in 30 minutes.","Do not do it. It's scary to bet on itself, if you do not, nobody will. I'm not saying that to pat my fist. Even if a punch would be great. I mean it."
"Ok, this is crazy. You can not believe that New Jersey is better than New York. In New York, there was Broadway. No need to say more.","Oh, yes. Tape for safety."
"It was Atlantic City.","You can not b*at A.C. Pity! Nobody needs to know."
"New Jersey coast.","Chronicles of the Oscar-winning on urban neurotic.Tape!"
"Yes, except I hate it. I'm too big for New York! I try to hold seats in the cramped subway or stoop under doors over 150 years. People are taller, have larger doors. What is your problem?","Small town, big men, then tope."
"Stella back.","Silence embarrassed. Tope then."
"Oh, thank you! Wait. Good evening, New York.","Look, it did."
"It really stops.","You think you're there for something?"
"I think so. Good job, Barney.","Oh, my God! Thank you! Oh, I k*ll my arm. My arm has never been so sore since I was 13 the day I knew how to close the bathroom. Cool!"
"Barney arrives at the bar, disguised as a senior.","You there, what's your name?"
"Excuse me?","Your name, woman, what's your name?"
"Wife Cindy.","I knew it. You are ""the"" Cindy, one that can change everything and bring us to our downfall. Listen to me, Cindy. I am Barney Stinson, and I have an urgent mission from the future."
"From the future?","The future, and I can prove it to you. In exactly four seconds, the woman at this table will slap this man."
"You mean what?","I have not the time to explain. I must return to reality accelerator before the vortex closes. Only you can save us, Cindy. I must go!"
"Barney enters the bar.","Vive la vodka."
"My God, you are... ho, my God! I offer you a drink?","I guess I have time for a drink and 45 minutes to an hour for other activities, but after that, I must return to the top secret research project I'm working on."
"Global warming?","My God! How do you know that?"
"It's good enough!","It does not stop a fight between girls! Ever!"
"Barney reaches a bottle in his hand.","This is the man of the evening. It's time to let the monster out of his cage!"
"It's true. We live.","You're going to seriously continue to wear this hat?"
"Then Barney.","What?"
"Specifically, those with fire.","The magic tricks? Guys, interventions are meant to help people, not to address every aspect you do not like.Sorry, but it warms me. It makes me boil! I mean, I am filled with a burning rage! Thanks! Oh, shit."
"What was your biggest problem with me and Stella?","Yes! In the mouth! You said that the ""Barney the future"" work out. You told me I was crazy. My shrink told me I was crazy. Which is the narcissist with severe emotional disorders, Dr. Grossbard? A banner of intervention?That's what?"
"Stella.","""I can not remain indifferent... """
"You kept it on you?","Please. ""I can not remain impassive while you make the biggest mistake a man can do... get married. Keep my words, it will all part... ""Flames! Oh, shit! I sent the flame too soon. I had so many important things to say, and... The fact is, Ted, marriage is stupid. Each year there are a million girls aged 22, sexy, who go to bars and call me, ""glass half full"", but I think they become beasts."
"Even you, you will meet more girls in 22 years when you get 80.","I meet this challenge."
"What challenge?","Prove that I will be just as great at 80. I'll go out with a girl of 22 years with my old man makeup."
"Barney at the bar, again disguised as a senior.","Good evening, young lady. You want a caramel?What do you mean, ""nothing in common""? We're both older."
"You're cute. How old are you?","83 years. How old are you?"
"Oh, my God!","I think someone owes me $ 200."
"Barney, it was not a gamble. Person...","This proves that I will be as great as that when I have 80 years. Tope my arthritis."
"Because it will age like it or not, then the real question is: do we want to go forward or clinging desperately to the past and end up like that?","You mean great? I am 80 years old guy, and I pack a girl of 22 years."
"Take me with you, darling. I want to see your medals from World w*r II.","In an instant my child."
"Okay, it matters not.","What? Why?"
"Amazing.","It's amazing."
"Not at all.","That was after you to be part."
"Barney enters the apartment, disguised as old.","What...?"
"Barney is an intervention.","Sorry, I hear you."
"That's enough, the trick of ""old.""","The trick in the middle?"
"Forget it.","Leave baby? I love this old rhyme!"
"I will get my problem.","You're going to get my boat?"
"It is.","Okay, burial of bachelorhood. Tonight, I have three exotic dancers most flexible physically and mentally that you've ever seen..."
"No time.","I'll tell you."
"Do we really have to rent the cars for tomorrow.","What?"
"No ""You not married, Ted?"" No ""You're making a big mistake, Ted?"" Have you stopped the fight against marriage?","No, I recognize a lost cause, when I see it. That's why I'm not recycle. In addition, Ted getting married, it is my interest. You know..."
"Barney is in his office.","I worked on an issue of utmost importance. I admit I was baffled. Until I decided to take the bull by the horns.(Barney written on a board: how to lie down again with Robin) Then, finally, I décryptais code. ""GIVE THE MARRIAGE OF TED. """
"So you come back to Robin.","Let's hope. This weekend is my best chance to start with it."
"You'll never there. Too many opportunities. The first bridesmaid drunk, you'll have your head under the dress as a photographer of yesteryear.","Lily, kidding. I want to look cutesy and romantic, but this weekend, Robin will be the only girl that I will draw."
"It's not really the place I imagined for the wedding of Ted.","""The Collective Namaste Yoga and Meditation."""
"Honey, will see the dirty hippie to the reservation there, we, we'll take to drink.","You have anything like Scotch?"
"Yes, and they are all 100% vegan.","I need alcohol. I'm not gonna do that stuff with Robin.Look at that. Berry cocktail, conditioner meninges. I dream, these drinks could make a girl smarter. What hell Ted brought us?"
"I know. I understand something is ""no ex"". Why would we want that history failed to come see one successful?It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners World Series. It's embarrassing for everyone.","What? No. Robin must come."
"I do not care, why do such.","Dude, Robin has to be there."
"It should not come.","What are you parl..."
"It's gonna be the worst phone call of all time.","Co-witness, I'll handle this."
"I'm off to the airport.","OK, in a few hours. Have a good flight. Bad news. I can not have it. Robin is gone."
"You are Barney?","Yes."
"I heard you were a real bastard, so listen. Tomorrow night, I want to do things so nasty and depraved that I forget that it was supposed to be my wedding.","I'm here with someone."
"This is the big day. You hydrate?","Dear wife, thank you for the interest you have for Barney Stinson..."
"Your back will look like a Jackson Pollock.","I regret to inform you that at this time..."
"I have been vegan for 2 years. I need meat.","There are currently no positions available."
"I am a teacher of Yoga. All positions are possible. Your room in 20 minutes. No preliminary.","I will not do, huh?"
"I spend a very bad day. I've stolen scotch at the duty free. It tells you?","Let's go to your room. Far from it. And can be the whistle."
"I have no room. In fact, I thought I could stay with you.","No problem. I just need to tidy up a little. Of clothes on the floor and..."
"And a girl naked, tied to your bed.","The towels in the bathroom, a real mess. So, give me 10 minutes... to restore order..."
"OK, let's go. Who's that?","The girl on reception."
"He rises from his chair, dancing and going to turn the jukebox.","I watch this young man dancing near the jukebox, and I can not help thinking... Stella may have made the right choice. Ouch!"
"How can he dance here? He should be trying to smash the car with a club of Stella.","Assumption. He is not pretending to be happy. Ted is really happy. He did not want to marry from the start. Ted had the best train dodge since Stand by Me Well, not the first kid, but others."
"Barney entered the apartment with two women.","Hey, kid."
"Barney, I'm fine! It is not necessary, and it is rather unhealthy. Sorry, ladies.","I did not know you'd be here. Girls stairwell."
"It's OK.","Guys, let him go. He is happy. Listen, if Ted was married, then he would be married, he would live in New Jersey, and he would be married. It is well. Good, let's eat. Let Flat Michael's?"
"Two blocks from her mother's hairdresser.","Okay, Ted, is there a place in Manhattan where one can dine?"
"He is serious?","I will not in this table. Possibly, in this one."
"She looks happy? She talked about me? I do not care.Where are the almonds?","Where may well be nuts Ted? You should check the garage in the grip of Stella."
"End flashback",".. a couple were atrocious. It did not work. You always love Robin, but remember the other women... And above all, the other breast, and all the cool stuff you do with breasts... Y to the head, juggle... squeaker squeaker... I'm a hopeless romantic.And there are drawings of breasts."
"The Gazeur nickname stuck. He had so much ridicule, he had to change schools.","The kids are great."
"Ted, this is ridiculous.","I am a person who... Well, are facing. There are a bunch of people I do not want to see... as the group of ""girls that I skipped""... but if one of them came here, I would stay there, and I would look into his eyes. For some, this would be the first time."
"Really, you hide from anybody? Not even... Becca Delucci?","Son of a bitch."
"Who is Becca Delucci?","Becca is this girl who lives in the North. I saw her from time to time."
"Where exactly in the north, Barney?","Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary."
"Barney is in the parlor with a woman.","And yes, the visits were of a conjugal nature."
"That's not true?","Really. And that I had with Becca was a perfect relationship. She was allowed to call me once a week. If it becomes too sticky, the armed guards stoppaient. I've never had to pay for dinner. In fact, this is false. I pay taxes. I guess we all paid for dinner. Thank you, guys. Anyway, at the last visit, I screwed up."
"Flashback","Passed. Who wants to do something to 3? Lisa, wait."
"You're the only thing that kept me here.","That's why I'm here, baby. I am your strength. I'm...Oh, my God. Hello, stranger. Barney Stinson, attorney. Let's talk about your output."
"My father.","Boy, this sure is another table. What are we talking?"
"My body started to change...","Wait a second. Sorry, continues."
"And Kyle and I are doing anything serious. It was only the blue line.","The blue line?"
"I'll talk to him. She's gone. I'll catch up.","There, there."
"I will say, ""Sorry it did not work. ""We will discuss in adults. She'll tell me his views and... I will listen. What I should have done more before.","You can fly it into the lamp? Fasten your seat belts!Not you, Ted."
"That's his problem.","Come on, Ted. She left you on the altar."
"Get rid of your demons!","I have ants in my leg!"
"It k*ll!","From cold blood."
"Ted's friends are in McClaren's.","I'm not impressed by the talent here tonight. And more I drink, the less it is attractive. I'm a whiskey and Coke in the Cantina scene in Star Wars."
"And those girls over there? They are cannon.","Absolutely not."
"Barney, they are canon.","There is so much to learn. You are only victims of...the effect cheerleaders. Good question. The effect cheerleading is when a group of women air cannon, but only in groups. As with the cheerleaders. They look like cannon, but take them individually? Cod."
"Anything.","Look at it carefully. Individually."
"Yeah, really cute.","And this, my friends, is ""the effect cheerleaders."" Also known as the paradox of a bridesmaid syndrome sorority, and for a brief moment in the 90s, the conspiracy of the Spice Girls.Scary Spice, indeed. Barney Stinson. OK.Understood. Great, we remember."
"You're gonna be a father? How will it happen?","It's a girl I plugged in a few weeks ago. It is not certain.She sees the doctor tomorrow."
"That may be a false alarm. It is perhaps not pregnant.","No part of Barney Stinson does not run at less than 110%. If one of my Michael Phelps escaped, he swims for gold. It's a nightmare. I want no children. How can want to have children without being mad?"
"Barney is in a church, and pray.","God? It's me, Barney. Are you okay? I know we will not speak often, a bunch of girls said your name on my account. Great. But, God... If you could get out of there, I swear I'll never, never... never, never, never... Wait, man. Barney to the device.Really?"
"It happens in Marshall's office.","Good news! I'm not a father!"
"Congratulations, buddy.","This is the best time of my life, Marshall. What I feel in having no children? I have never thought something like it as much. That's why I created a public holiday. Now, today is ""Day of Non-fathers."""
"You create a holiday?","Why not? Everyone has one: mothers, fathers, soldiers. Why not a day for singles who like it?"
"Hello, Stinson.","Hi. How are the children?"
"I'm not sorry. I'm just disappointed.","That's it!"
"Barney and Marshall are in the conference room.","The No-Fathers Day is a success! Laraby Finklestein and help me celebrate. Matt. Mugs ""Best Non-Father of the world."" There... T-shirts ""Who is your daddy? ""Available on fetedesnonperes.com. Looking greeting cards."

"At the bar...","But huh?"
"At the bar, Barney joined Ted and Robin to the table.","The last great idea for Fathers Day-No, a pregnancy test, but instead of a blue line, there is a small blue Barney who does that."
"Day of Non-Fathers, it sucks. It's a feast for the losers.","What are you talking? This is a good group of friends."
"This is the effect cheerleaders.","No, Ted. It works for girls."
"Ted and Robin out of the bar, leaving Barney alone.","Sock."
"Barney sings karaoke.","""And the cat is in the cradle and the silver spoon Little Boy Blue and the Man on the Moon. When are you going back home, Dad? I do not know when we're together then, son I know we will have a good time. """

"Which one?","The last time you and I are just competing for the title of best friend Ted."
"Marshall is my best friend.","Exactly. Draw. But it's all about to change. Is it correct that you are an architect?"
"My best friend does not, but still.","You draw what now?"
"No, not the New York Public Library. This is the library Nouillorc, in Dakota. Their books are in two parts: fishing and not fishing.","I think you'll love what's happened at work."
"Who's going to draw?","That was my first question."

"Listen, Stinson, no one hates all the other countries of the world than me, but you have arguments?","Yes. I know a great American architect who would be perfect. Ted Mosby."
"You realize what a hero I'd be if I brought this project to my box?","It's not the best. We three, we'll work together."
"Ted will come to call.","Yes, totally."
"What is it?","It works like this: one of us goes into the office the other and said..."
"Marshall is in his office with two men. Barney comes to see.","Marshall, the teleconference begins soon."
"Sorry, I gotta go.","And then you go up on the roof... and drink beer."
"It's great. Drinking at work.","Basically, it is of ""Mad Men."""
"Yes! There is too much ""Mad Men""!","I'll spank a secretary."
"That's exactly what they would do in this series.","What series?"
"I love to do that.","I will realize your dream."
"Okay, be cool with me. This is a first draft.","Ted, it's incredible. Detail. Shadows. The liveliness of the lines. This is exactly what Princess Leia would look like, topless."

"No thank you... drag ignorant.","Lily Aldrin, little secretive. For years, I say that our gang needs a Woo, and thou hast hid me in a whole herd."

"Wooo!","Well you'll excuse me, I have a date with Bataille and Fontaine."
"Hey, Barney! Give me the good news.","You did not have."
"I can not believe I had not. I thought I had hit the nail. Why did they choose Sven?","I've done everything to change their minds. But they did not budge. I'm sorry."
"I think I need it.","Finish Your Beer. Fill the machine."
"Barney is in the meeting room.","It's okay. All withdrawals at ATMs are free."
"You wanna tell me something?","Good grief. I told Heather to put everything back as it was on your desk."
"Bilson told me he wanted to give the job to Ted.What has happened?","Okay."
"Ted leaves the room.","Uncle Larry, sky gods. Niagara Falls. It is empty."
"It was great. I like it.","It looks like we had our man. I not think there need to see..."

"Barney supports and fire proceeds from the mouth of the dinosaur.","It's building the coolest of the universe. It could not be more awesome."
"What is your problem? This is the big break of Ted!You have betrayed to work in the brain of a Tyrannosaurus, which, incidentally, if you knew the dinosaurs is very, very small.","It's not my office. The building was well Ted. That of Sven was better. And I will not let the fact that I am the best friend of Ted influence business."
"You have not chosen one of Sven because he was better. You wanted an office dinosaur.","It's a lie! I chose it because it... He breathes fire, Marshall."
"""Fire Marshall"".","I have not even paid attention."
"How could you do that to Ted after all that happened with Stella? You are an egoist.","I never made a career choice by selfishness. I am a professional. Go. Spend a good day, drunk, and throw the bodies of the pigeons."
"No. For two reasons. A, pigeons are smarter than you think. They are resentful. And two, it's our last conference call, Mr. Stinson. There are repercussions to ride a friend.","Like what?"
"Barney is still on the roof but Sven had joined him.","That's great, Sven. You are so much cooler than Marshall. He has not even mix. Who wants a foam?"
"I do not understand. Where is the call?","It's the call. Got it? In America, when we work late, you lie on a conference call, and here we ascend a few beers. It's great."
"What hat?","It turned Sven."
"It's weird.","Your plans were the best and you deserve it. You should know one thing that you did not get the job early. You see, Ted..."
"It was Bilson. Bilson wanted to have a head office in the dinosaur, Barney convinced him that it was really, really stupid.","You know..."
"Thank you, Barney. I believe it. I brought in my box the largest contract that she had. Wooo! The next is for me.","Why you helped me?"
"You did the right thing. You got a well deserved boost. And then it would have disappointed Ted, and it is finally... very happy for the moment.","You are truly the best friend Ted. And me too. Tie.Thank you, Marshall."
"I love you, man.","Me too, buddy."
"You mount the bull?","No, even if you pay me. I have an inner ear problem."
"He falls down and the bull.","That's right, girls."
"It is now McClaren's with Barney.","You can not measure something like that in a while. It is step by step. From his bed at the front door. Bam! You're outside. Next!"
"Two out of three. He assured me.","Seriously. No chance it works on Robin. It will come, take a look at this idiot and send tampers."

"There's a girl there in a sweater wrap. He does not listen to a word they say. Hein, Barney?","Leave me alone!"
"He understood, there is little time, he could hold a conversation with just the titles of sitcoms ""black"" of the 70s and 80s.","What's going on?"
"Barney, you wanna go and get my stuff does not Marshall?","Diff'rent Strokes."
"Doug Martin was in McClaren's bartender. He was always in the corner.","You... Been to Ted?"
"We're going down the aisle and fight with these guys.","What's going on?"
"A fight. We gotta go?","No, I would fight for three things, the closing of a stubborn bra, accusations of sexual harassment... 9 of 9! And wanted to vomit when I see someone wearing brown shoes with a black suit."
"No, it's true! I love it! I have a culture of hockey. If a guy is a fighter, it is rather sexy. And scars, seriously! If a guy has one, it has a Robin. And if he lost a tooth, I lose my panties.","I lost my wisdom tooth. Without surgery. Local anesthesia. Frankly, it's nothing."
"My brothers.","Yeah, it was surely the ruckus in the playroom of Eriksen."
"Ted part.","Me too! Guys... watch what face. The next time you see it, it will be distorted as the sexiest possible. Because that's what I am: a real man. I like to fight and do battle in the dirt. You find me a wooden hanger for that?"
"Ted and Barney arrive in the driveway but Doug already has to KO the other guy.","It's been what?"
"He thinks he fought with him.","We fought with him. So we will go and tell everyone the legendary story of how we b*at types. And everyone will find it great and everyone goes back to bed with me."
"Come on man, no one will believe we fought, we look at.","Oh, it's good..."
"To go home?","No, for that."
"You hit me in the nose!","Are you crying?"
"Yes, I cry! You hit me in the nose!","It's going to swell to death. You're going to look like Owen Wilson. Come on, we go."
"Just look at that eye. You look like a bad boy. I did not know you had it in me. You. That you had it in you.","You... want to touch?"
"You know what, Doug? I will gladly pay. And why?As adults do. They pay their glasses, and they fight it. You know what I did when you were kids? That's what I did.","Your nails?"
"No. I was...","your best to not cry when Big came to Carrie at the end of the film Sex and the City?"
"So you've just b*at?","Just?"
"Amanda, was it that simple? You know, the fight in melee, it is more than using force against his opponent, huh B?","Exactly!"
"But I do not understand, what they did to deserve this?","It may seem insignificant, but they got to our table."
"At our table.","And..."
"No one.",".. no one sits at our table."
"Robin arrives at that time.","Let's b*at them up. Ted, come on. You two. Our table.Go. Now!"
"He's not here tonight.","I offer you what? A drink? Money? These two girls over there?"
"And you're Barney Stinson?","They know who you are. All right, guys. It lets you go without kick your ass. This time. Okay?"
"The two men leave the bar.","That was close."
"as*ault! They continue to attack us!","What is the penalty for as*ault? I'll have a fine?Picking up garbage on the highway? Because I already did that."

"Yes, I just told them you were wimps. It has made us laugh. Poilade good, actually. I said that you did manicure every month.","Weeks, Wolverine... Some are careful."
"Marshall, Barney, Lily and Robin are in the driveway with Doug.","We can tell you..."
"It's true. They have nothing to do with it. Look at them.","It's Ted's fault!"
"Barney comes running.","OK, I'm hot. Let's go. What has happened?"
"Christmas 2005...","Drop your trousers. Mine hard. Under the bunch of mistletoe, I'll make your sister moan. Oh! Dear Heather, Heather dear, we'll do it in all directions..."

"Incredibly gay. Dude, quail out there.","Why, hello. I was expecting you."
"One second. It is not our chair. You've made yourself?","I needed one that rotates."
"Do not tell me anything! You know I can not keep secrets if it's almost Christmas! Robin offers you an iPod!","Can I talk to one second in the kitchen? Not touch the chair. I praise him. I can not believe that thou hast hid thy sister all these years."
"Really? You're like ""Weird Al"" Yankovic to write that song on how to jump my sister.","First, I'm flattered. Then it's just jokes. A friend can joke on a friend's sister. Does not mean I'm going to act."
"I love my sister, and as a big brother, it's my job to protect guys like you.","You do not trust me?"
"No. And it either.","Okay. All right. I'll just... take my chair and leave."
"Wait... Rest... Back... Lily and I were dining out with Heather Sunday. Want to go?","I have already called to add a person."
"You really can not tell Lily.","No, nothing really..."
"Lily, Barney and Ted are the sister restaurant.","I'll take the vichyssoise with a hint of cream. Dairy ballonnent me."
"Let me think.","It, it means he will not."
"We'll talk later, OK?","You do not have any illusions."
"You're my sister.","There he just says the obvious."
"I just think you have no idea of the difficulty of succeeding in New York.","Exactly. Do you need relationships. If only Ted knew someone who works at, say... Goliath National Bank, then...expect. What? I work for Goliath National Bank. Incredible!"
"My God!","None of this is true! The truth is that... Betty and Tyler are actors I hired to pretend to be my family."
"Ted and his sister are in McClaren's with Lily and Barney.","I think your prospects are good for GNB. U you have shown me that you can take any position."
"This is the new coasters?","I hope you get the job. Nothing makes me happier than to fill an opening."
"OK, enough! I can not believe you hast slept with my sister!","You've sneaked?"
"Come on. Lily saw you.","Oh yeah?"
"Heather and Barney's Barney's office and get naked.","You see, Ted, you have so little faith in me and Heather..."
".. That we decided to show you what you expect from us.","And as we can count on Lily to sneak."
"Because you deserve it.","Ted, you know, I'm not a saint. And yes, it is true that the times I drove your mother at the airport, say that there has been a... sexually confused and confusing time in the parking lot, but I said I draguerai not your sister, and I thought. You should have me believe."
"You're so convinced that I am still a teenager out of control, you forgot that I grew up. I'll find a hotel. I will take my business later. Merry Christmas.","Your mother and I, we kissed."
"Ted and Barney are at McClaren's.","I explained. I said, Madeline, every international conflict essentially boils down to sexual tension."
"All international conflicts?","All, man."
"So, the crisis in the Middle East could be solved by...","Gaza Strippers. Next."
"Apartheid?","""Apartouze"". You have what?"
"The Cold w*r?","""Mrs. Gorbachev, removed her underwear."""
"Marshall gives the key to Robin.","You... have slept together. What are épouv...stouflant. Epouvstouflant. Well done, Ted. Bravo."
"Yes. Thank you, Barney. You were right. Peace was established. More than once.","So, I am responsible for... Excellent. Excellent.Excellent. The next tour is for me!"
"Are you okay?","Yes. Why you ask?"
"For one thing, you cry openly.","From joy. I am so happy for them."
"Barney, admit it. You always have feelings for Robin and it tortures you.","I'm going quite well. Excuse me just a minute. I'm going quite well."
"You must learn to express your feelings. Perhaps you should see a psychiatrist.","Wait. If I pay a woman $ 200 an hour to feel better, it will not discuss. And there will be both on the couch. The woman in my scenario, she is a prostitute. Dirty, vulgar, all redone, from Eastern Europe..."
"I knew you had not of paddler!","Wonderful, we still speak of that!"
"You do not want me to see if the waitress at a huge scale for this haughty tone with you? Nobody likes reading a magazine at work and they say they are not human.","Dude, I read a magazine at work every day. I will not say how many meetings where I was late because I 'was reading a magazine. "" But I'm not ashamed of that. This is my moment. Sure, ""magazine is read"" is not sexy, but you know, this is something I have to do. Why be ashamed? Wait, ""read a magazine"" that's wank, right?"
"This is the ideal plan. Each time you start to yell, he lieth in place. One minute you're on the back of each other, and the one after that, well, the same thing.","Super."
"This morning, she cried through the door, ""You're too long in the shower! "". A second later, she joined me. There, it has not bothered me to take my time.","If great."
"Sorry for the delay. I was typing a Scherbatsky. She used all my stamps, so in short, the postman rang twice. Should you stamp it!","It's... just... if... Excuse me one second."
"Barney is in an appliance store.","So, plasmas are better in low light, but the LCD is best to play?"
"Okay, but CRTs have the deepest blacks.","So if I want a very good contrast ratio..."
"The deep structure of the CRT pixel resolution produces unrivaled in LCD.","I take the CRT."
"Barney, it's crazy.","I'm fine, thank you."
"No, it's wrong. You must learn to get it out. As we did in my kindergarten class. ""The time for emotions"", every Tuesday morning.","Look, maybe your kids resent their friends sleep together, but not me. I have never been better."
"Do you have any?","Yes, I love it. That's what... It's you, man."
"No. It meant nothing. It was just a reflex when we were a couple. But I did everything go wrong.","Clearly. This is the end."
"What is your problem?","This one."
"Barney takes out the trash, when Ted returns.","Thank you."
"Ted opens the fridge full.","I took it in passing. It's nothing."
"You have bought us a dishwasher?","It has always been there. You've been here how long?"
"So you take it all and you can avoid to argue, eh?","Exactly. I worry about you."
"It bothers you that we sleep together, right?","Not at all. It's crazy. What?"
"You're in love with Robin? You're in love with Robin.That's why you not want people sleeping together.","What? You say anything. A friend can not clean the apartment of another friend like friends do?"
"Cite me a buddy in the story of friends who has already done that.","I give you two: Clean and gentlemen Solcarlus."
"That thing between me and Robin is completely innocent.I flipperai if you tell me not feel something for her. This is the case?","No. This is not true, no. This is not true, no. No. Robin is all yours, man. Exploding yourself with it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go sleep with other girls."
"Are you sure?","Yes!"
"Positive?","Absolutely."
"Barney is in the class of Lily.","And I went with a bang. Why did I do that? It comes perhaps my father issues, but... basically, I allowed my best friend to sleep with the girl of my dreams. I completely sabotaged. And now, I smoke. I smoke."
"Get out of here.","But it's time and emotions I Emotive, bears sharing.Whoever Emotive, Bear's shares, can sit on the chair of the division."
"Barney is now in his office. Between Marshall.","Great, it's Lily who sent you? I have not the bear, OK?I will make it! Why are you smiling?"
"I just... reading a magazine. Here at work.","What?"
"Thank you. I would have done well at some point.Sometimes you have to... You have to say and... go there.","Marshall, I gotta go. In fact, there are toilets here, if you want to use."
"Barney arrives at Ted's apartment.","Ted, I must tell you the truth. I love... tacos. What are you doing?"
"I go step-louse. If you are looking for Ted, he was released. And... our little arrangement is... completed, by the way.","Really? That's Wife... vantable."
"Epousvantable?","Yes, it is épousvantable. What has happened?"
"He insisted. He said ""no longer able to do"" if ""it hurt someone."" I think we all know who he is talking about.","Oh?"
"It's not obvious?","It is?"
"Yes. This is Ted. You know how it romantic. He can not separate the physical emotion. It is kind of...","I love you."
"Right. It's not like you, you know? In addition, we are friends. I want to complicate matters by committing. Hanging out with friends never works. So... you want to go eat a taco?","A Taco?"
"You love them, right?","Just."
"But... you are an inspiration to us all, you are so dedicated and linked. I look at you, and that's all I want in the world.","There are two students out, and they look easy!"
"Arizona... You know... I always wanted to see what looks like a license in Arizona.","I already did that. 21 years."
"You have a group? We will perhaps see you.","Excuse me one second. What is your problem? We will not see them play."
"Yes, but these girls they sleep with Van Halen after?","If you want to sleep with Van Halen, do it on your spare time. We're not guys who-could-come-you-see. It is the other guys, those older, who ever came and whose recognition is required."
"We are their fathers?","Exactly. This is a great meeting, I think that we can come. Another time, girls."
"If you want to see us afterwards, we can exchange our numbers.","Excuse us a minute. Have you gone crazy? We do not want their numbers."
"I know not what I was doing. I had panic there.","Qua na you exchange a number, you give him the opportunity to call to cancel. If you give a number without an appointment, they must come. Checkmate! No number, just my fingers. Truck."
"They go back again.","Why not arrange to meet you here tomorrow night to 22h."
"I think it will snow. What do we do if there is a blizzard?","Whatever happens, we will be there."
"That's all ""ski"" account.","Sorry one last time."
"What is the problem here?","Well done."
"The two women leave.","'Definitely. Great! ""Dude, these students seem stupid."
"Bluntly.","Awesome. Here's the thing: tomorrow night, dress up well, it will move!"
"We would still have had to make their numbers.","You always imagine the worst. Ted, I promise, everything will be okay. It begins to snow."
"It's really bad outside. They will not.","But if it will come. It has to. If I can touch one of those girls, I get a ""Bingo party student."" Come on, Ted. You're the only one here."
"Sorry, a ""Bingo party student""?","Every year, Playboy publishes a list of the best student parties in the country. I take the top 25, and I do... a bingo card. All I need now that Arizona Tech, which is crazy. In a contest, it would be given automatically."
"How many people are on this festive bingo student?","Just me."
"What is the purpose then?","The goal is to make it five in a row."
"And you got what, if you succeed?","I have a bingo."
"No! It is only 21h.","And it rocks here, yo!"
"I'm really sorry, but I have to install beds in the church. It becomes a refuge, snowy nights.","selfish bastard! There are two cannons girls who come to us here."
"You two? Impossible. You ignore the low bar.","Serve the g*n first?"
"There should be a bar.","Of course, we should have a bar!"
"You really should have a bar.","It really should have a bar."
"Our bar would be great.","And dude, dude, dude, dude... The name of our bar will be... Puzzles. People will, ""Why Puzzles? ""That's the puzzle."
"That's... a great name for a bar! And also, Puzzles: no nightcap.","No nightcap!"
"Except where everyone ended up spending the best night of his life, then we put the chairs on the tables and pulled out the margarita fountain.","There should be a bar."
"Barman. Triple Sec.","It happens, keep tap. We will buy one."
"Ted slides the glass on the counter but Barney does not catch up.","Served."
"Reminds me of when I was sledding with my father... before he leaves.","And prem's."
"It is the intention of getting drunk. Really get drunk.As my father did.","Prem's, prem's prem's."
"There's no sink. And you get out of the kitchen.","Is there anything in a gin and tonic? There's what in a gin and tonic?"
"Hold a bar, it sucks. Is closed.","No nightcap! Puzzles, Barney here."
"Well, you're still there. I arrive in 5 minutes.","Last glass."
"Barney makes people out of the bar.","Okay, go. You are not obliged to return, but you can not stay. I always wanted to say that. I mean, in a bar. I say all the time with me."
"We said no last drink. We must do.","We should do what? Carl will be there from one moment to another."
"Caring for a bar, it's boring. We should stick to what we know.","We should start a band."
"Guys, this festival is great! You are true friends of Hens fighting. If necessary, do not hesitate to ask.","The flute section does she see anyone?"
"This is a great band name. Have you seen Amanda?","Bingo!"
"These guys think what? I am far from my phase ""dating a prisoner."" It's like: ""Hi, I am over 19 years.""","The daughter of the lottery is there."
"I'm sorry for these women. This is where careers go to die on TV.","Look. It's funny. I invented a little game"
"The lotto numbers tonight are... 19...","Your age on arrival in New York after a photographer you have ""discovered"" to be published in Vogue."
"53...","The number of nude photos that he has done before you realize he had no connection to Vogue."
"22...","The age that you say you have."
"31...","Your real age."
"45...","The number of minutes for me to put in a taxi, get undressed and into my Jacuzzi."
"And the super bowl tonight is...","What happens after that is out of the jacuzzi. Great?"
"I went very confident. I knew it was just me against two other girls.","I listening."
"I will not be a presenter at Channel 10, right?","It just fell."
"If you think people liked your show, it's wrong...","Bizarre. Look at what is mixed with your fan mail."
"My work permit. If I can not find a job in the coming...seven days, they will refer me to Canada.","I can not believe you that turns the country."
"Good question, Norm. For the first, I was an intern for Channel 22 in Red Deer. Alberta. In Canada. The snow falls hard enough, but these intrepid fishermen are still happy to contribute to the gathering of bass fishing Lake Athabasca, a tradition of 1 August To you, Norm. What? It was my first job. It shows where I come from.","Unless a bear attacks you in 3 seconds with your legs and you break his neck, it has nothing to do in your demo."

What you need is a super video resume. Like mine. I present to you: Barneysvideocv.com.(The video starts with an expl*si*n) Hello. Barney Stinson, you have achieved great successes in business, sport and personal relationships, and have been an inspiration to many people."
"Is that you? You INTERVIEWED yourself?","How could that be me? He is an Englishman. What would you recommend to your many admirers who want to reach the peak of their potential?"
"And a little Scottish.","The first thing to know about success is that it will not come to you. Most people associate success with money and power, but in fact it is a mindset."
"You were supposed to be on a motorcycle to say that?","And when it comes to success, the only limit is that there is no limit."
"Barney, I do not understand. You doing anything in these clips.","Exactly. Because that's what the world wants to work.People who seem to take risks, but never do anything. In fact, you do things will turn. I write a book about this phenomenon."
"The possimpossible? Oh yeah?","Inventing your own word shows creativity and vision...""Visia-ness."" If I can leave you with one thought, is this one: nothing... and all... is possimpossible. This guy is awesome."

"What? I will be deported. I would try anything.","OK, we should get started. I have much to sh**t, I can not use the tapes I have of you."
"Bands on me?","Let's start."
"Barney did his apartment a TV studio, where Robin is presenter.","What does it mean to be a reporter for you?"
"Since I was little...","Cut! You're mired in details. We need you to be vague, at ease with buzzwords like ""synergy"" and ""dynamism"". You can invent a word, as... ""Relationality."""

"These clothes are ridiculous. In addition, the armor of the amazon princess itch.","Showdown. You're not the first to wear it here. But it expresses the power. And that, too. Now, I need you break these 15 bricks with your forehead."
"What? But you do anything in your video. You were right next to a horse and sitting on a motorcycle.","I am a man. You're a woman. Assume that you can do nothing. You must prove that society is wrong."
"I can not break 15 bricks with my forehead.","There is more in 1950. Yes, you can."

"Barney enters the apartment.","What's the matter?"
"Robin must leave Canada.","Oh, my God. It's horrible. It'll be along to commute."

"It's amazing!","I sent them shit."
"Dude!","They want you even more. So they increased their offer by 10%. Congratulations. Looks like you'll have to stay."
"How did you do that?","I am the master of possimpossible."

"Seriously? They are blond and stuffed. This is not your type?","Maybe I did not like. My God, you think that the male spirit is really so simple, we all have a favorite type? Lord.Asian, big tits. I go to the bathroom, then I'm going."
"Barney is sitting in his office.","OK, to Saturday. I was thinking of a brunch, and perhaps a hike. I love you too."
"You think it is possible that Barney Stinson has a girlfriend?","A plus."
"Wait. Where are you going?","Nowhere. At the beach. It's winter. Laser Tag. At home. Shut up! It is you who are going somewhere."

"Guilty. I love you.","Me too."
"Me-seven!","Will in, little rascal! I'll see you at the bar?"
"What's that, Barney?","It's a long story. As you know, my father had to leave my mother when I was a baby because he became presenter of the Just Price."
"Bob Barker is your father.","She had to raise my brother and I, all alone. And his only wish was that his son did not end up alone like her. And there seven years, she fell ill."
"Barney is c hospital alongside his mother.","I do not think she was going to make. So I decided to fulfill his wish. Mom. This is Betty. We're engaged."
"It's crazy. Did you actually cast your own son?","For a while, it was enough to borrow / keep the baby from neighbors. And once at Christmas, my mother was drunk at the grog, I went out with a bag of flour and a Chucky mask.But eventually I had to audition."
"Many children are before Barney, with numbers.","four, eight... thirteen, you stay. The other, you can leave."
"You said if I slept with you, my son would have the role.","Apparently I'm better actor than your son. Bring those from 11!"
"Barney's son arrives in the lounge.","And that's how the role of Tyler went to... Grant."
"Come on, Grant looks pretty good.","Really? Look. Tyler? Tyler? Tyler? Grant?"
"Yes?","You see? This is amateur work. Believe me, the child stars had better possession in the 80s."

Unfortunately, he loses in the final against another loser. But he learned an important lesson in accepting his defeat."
"Wait. When you watch Karate Kid, you are the wicked little blonde?","No, I'm for the other loser from New Jersey who barely knows karate. When I watch Karate Kid, I'm for real karate kid: Johnny Lawrence of Cobra Kai dojo. Do not get dumber than you are, Lily."

"But it's funny.","I can make another cast. Will remember your sentences for the big dinner scene."
"Wait. You wrote that we will have dinner?","Just a little script. Things that my mother will be pleased to hear."
"And I really thought that Barney had forgot our anniversary. So I rushed into the garden, smoke coming out of my ears.","The nostrils dilated. They do it when she gets mad. I love it. As now. Like now!"
"You better stop!","Sorry, my little bear. Continues. You really like that for a relationship."
"And my boy Ty-Ty. What's new?","Funny story, the other night, this little rascal had a nightmare. He came to tell us what it was, you remember what you said?"
"Thank you very much, man. Tonight I will not sleep.","Tyler said: ""In my nightmare, mom and you did not know how much I loved you. So I'm here to say it was great...like that. """

"You know not well what I mean?","No, not at all."
"Of course I do! And for sure I'll hear you admit it, manure!","Mom, you leave us a moment?"
"She leaves the kitchen and Marshall closes the door.","You've lost your mind?"
"She kisses Ted.","What's wrong with you? How do I explain this to my mother?"
"Honey, you okay?","Mom, I've got something to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. Tyler is dying. And Betty said that when he is gone, it will go out. So it may soon be over."

"Really.","I'm really relieved because in reality, I am also far from being a married man can be. My stories with women you would shock and horrify you."
"Whatever. I love you always.","Seriously, you can not imagine what I could do."
"When you were 3 years old, I left you with a babysitter and spent three weeks with Grand Funk Railroad, from one guy to another like a bang.","Mom!"
"The taxi is here.","I'll try."
"That I understand that. You tell me when you watch Karate Kid, you're not in San Daniel?","Nope!"
"Who do you like in Die Hard?","Hans Gruber, the villain class. At the end, it is trapped.This is the title character."
"OK, and Breakfast Club?","The teacher who is watching. This is the only one who passes the whole movie in a suit."

"It's good.","And twice that."
"So a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos?","Something even funnier happened to Marshall today."
"What do you want? Sometimes it's like that. The same thing over and over again. One of my students ate glue.","I have used questionable methods to skip a very silly girl."
"Karen is here?","You're kidding me!"
"This makeup has one month to go. I met with parents of Lily. I have never looked so stupid.","So far. Tells the story, tells the story!"
"Wait. It's really funny?","I'm not kidding. I almost do not want you to hear, because really, for the rest of your life, nothing will ever be as fun and you, curse you for agreeing to hear. You gotta hear it.This is too funny."
"Okay. Say it.","He searched his bag to get his stuff, and... No, say it.It's more fun if you say so. Let me say it. No, say it. You say.Say it. At the same time. No, go ahead."
"I forgot...","He forgot his pants!"
"She came to see you in college and when you had my back turned, she brought the guys in your room?","Respect."
"Are you kidding!","The pants!"
"Why do you want to lunch with an ex?","Good question, there are four reasons for a ""meal ex '.1: They want to get back together."

"Actually, there is one thing I wanted to give you.","g*n! She's got a g*n!"
"How to say goodbye in these situations? A kiss on the cheek, too familiar. A handshake, too formal.","And a hug is like a hug in public."
"The pants.","The pants! The pants!"
"It was nothing! I had a small problem, so I called Lily.","Tell us, what was this concern?"
"Ted, you're not going out so easily. While the history of pants is fun...","Fun? Rather, very fun."
"Okay! Lily came to the office to bring me my pants...","Why she did this?"
"Lily out of the elevator and crosses Barney.","Lily, what are you doing here?"
"I just give something to Marshall.","He ""give"" something. Understood. Nice."
"But I'm in a hurry. I can give it to you?","Of course, yes."
"And you give him?","Wait. I do not know. Yours had better be really good."
"What are you talking?","What about you?"
"Marshall forgot his pants, so I brought him one.","He forgot his pants. Good thing you came because today it has an important meeting, and it would be embarrassing and not at all funny if it were to show no pants. I will make sure he has."
"And you did not give him.","Theodore Evelyn Mosby. Of course I gave him. I gave him my word. It is concrete. For cons, I made a few alterations."
"Auditions for Oliver Twist are down!","Please, can I have more... pants?"
"Barney laughs alone.","More..."
"It shows my calves.","The pants. Still tells."
"Sorry, can not stay.","It's unfortunate!"
"Following the call from Karen, he left.","I do not know what it is, this shrew. Okay, she has boobs, but... In fact, I see."
"That is clear.","I've never seen."
"Sure!","I've never seen."
"Weather.","I've never seen."
"That's it. She's gone.","What a story. What courage to share it with us."
"Wait. That's your pajamas? You sleep in pajamas suit?","Of course. You think I'm sleeping in it?"
"It's not look comfortable at all. You wear a tie.","First, it's a tie night. Second, it's not for comfort. This class is to be at any time."
"Why have the class at any time?","Let me tell you a story that happened to me recently."
"This is not ""a"" skin flick, it's the scene... Forget it.","But it could happen. If it happened and I was in top form for these oiled bitches, I would regret it."
"Sorry, dude, but it is the nightwear most ridiculous I've seen in my life. Finally...","Marshall wearing a nightgown! He wears a nightgown! You know when they say, ""Remember, he was wearing a nightgown? ""It is now! This is a nightgown. Call it, ""Held danger of Ninja,"" if you want. You stay still a tr*nsv*stite."
"I do not care. It's comfortable.","Nice to fly to Neverland with Peter Pan? Me, again! It was nice to get out of bed to accompany Charlie to the chocolate? Oh, me, me! Something about Scrooge! Come on, guys. I do all the work."
"Why was it on your dresser?","It is pretty!"
"Bridge! I won!","You know not to play bridge, eh?"
"You're better off without her.","If the angel Clarence says it's true, it should be."
"You know what? Go ahead, laugh.","Why are you wearing this stuff?"
"Several reasons.","You can not even give five."
"Three: My grandfather was Olaf and he died at 107 years. Four: No elastic waistband leaving its mark around my Thanksgiving belly. And five: each night as I sleep, it's the most wonderful and free feeling in the world. I feel... as if I was flying. That's how I'm going to bed at night: happy, light. With a heart full of joy. And you?","I have to stand still to avoid offending my pajama suit.But at least I do not wear a dress."
"I can not believe it. I need another drink.","I feel a little breeze there. It's nice."
"You think that's good? Come to the mouth of heating.It's like your bazaar was on a tropical island.","The Little Barney says ""Mahalo."""
"Too glad you watched that one!","My God, what has happened?"
"You have not seen the show?","The show! Sorry. It happened something?"
"A shirt.","It's called a shirt."
"I want to hear!","Calm down! Let us be calm! I have a question. This is how when you're in bed?"
"Barney and Marshall are installed in the same bed.","You're at home, every night, and Lily layer always with you?"
"Yeah, marriage, man, unconditional love. You can wear what you want and you get laid.","Tell me about marriage."
"Sometimes when you're married, the smell of breakfast wakes you ready.","The coffee too?"
"The cafe also. Sometimes she even puts a vase of fresh flowers.","I love flowers. And sometimes when you're afraid of making wrong choices and you're not the one you wanted to be, what it does?"
"It says you're great and everything will be fine.","It's beautiful. And it helps you to find other girls to sleep with?"
"Lily, Marshall, Barney and Robin are in McClaren's.","Look at Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars. If I could get a celebrity, it would be Scarlett Johansson. Canon, talented and you do not turn as Woody Allen's father without issue."
"You know, the celebrities, they like really weird sex stuff. Believe me.","How do you know that?"
"Please, calm down. You swallow too much air.","But before you poursuives, I'm flattered, but technically I'm not a celebrity. Also, one last time, the mask, it was a joke."
"As you collect stamps or coins. But I say nothing.","Tell us at least the weird thing he wanted to do."
"I do not even know of Canadian sex act.","You have the Sled Dog, the Lobster Trap, the Mounted Police."
"How do you know that?","Canadiansexact.org, this is a favorite."
"Point org?","Yeah. It's nonprofit. They just want to disseminate information."
"I just had a conversation strange. A woman at the GNB told me that the new tower was abandoned last month. It's crazy, right? What is this look?","It is said? It should."
"No. I want to.","There's been no light."
"Tell him, you're his best friend.","No, it's you."
"No, it's really you. Shhh, it happens.","White or Asian? You see, I hardly know him."
"I'm frustrated. The least innovative thing in my drawings, Bilson cuts with a machete. I hate to depend on what kind of guy.","You should leave the project."
"It is clear, leave him. It is unworthy of you.","It's decided. A new beginning! May the winds be with you..."
"Are you kidding? They still come to turn a guy in my box.Bilson, is heavy, it is clear, but without this project, I have more work.","It's funny you mention the project. Because..."
"Ted from leaving Barn, ey and Marshall alone.","What was that?"
"I have an idea. The next two months Ted has paid anyway. We could not let it continue and not to tell her? He had a tough year. Let the fun a little.","You suggest a complicated lie in the long term that implies a lot of discipline. A guy like you will not succeed."
"But if I can.","Lie to me, there."
"I have a spaceship.","What kind of fuel?"
"I have no spaceship.","But no! Defend yourself! If someone asks, diverts it from the original lie with other lies. I show you. I have a pony.Question me."
"It is what color?","When I was Dandelion, her complexion was of a deep hazel, unfortunately, his barn is located near a chemical plant, which contaminated water. Over time, it became a dull gray and the vet can not do anything to help."
"Wait. If they canceled the project a month ago, why did I go every week to see the new working group?","Of course, you could not see you point and Bilson."
"Good job.","All right!"
"When you played third base for the softball team GNB.","There is no softball team. We just rented a field, a bunch of guys together so they make you a hero."
"False! Never lie to his friends. I should never have lied.","Really? And this open mic night at the Comedy Club?"
"Super. Very funny.","Fatal... Thursday evening for everyone."
"Hello, lying bastards. No lies before I go to work to get fired?","Nice shirt."
"Ted, Barney and Marshall are the GNB, in a room.","This is the P.T.E. 18th floor. Basically, Bilson wants a piece like that, two floors above us."
"Wait, what is a P.T.E.?","Room for Transitional Employees."
"What does that mean?","Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that bastard stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport."
"GNB think we need a safe place to meet new.","It's serious there."
"I love.","Really?"
"My God. I am so excited. I will read.","Read it."
"I do not understand any of these words.","One of them is supposed to be famous?"
"My hiccups are gone. Perhaps forever.","You again. You even found a way to spoil it. Why?Why let yourself do we as a country?"
"I can not work for large corporations with no heart. In selling me your ""working group"", I was the most inspired work of my career. In fact, you reminded me how my job could be fun when I'm not dealing with Bilson, so... I resigned.","They've turned, eh?"
"It's exciting.","With this economy?"
"Ultimately, I am grateful.","What was it with Bilson?"
"After he proposed a career change, I made an impromptu presentation with a four-step approach that put him in the knee.","You've hit with a chair?"
"Barney goes to the apartment where Marshall, Robin and Ted are already.","You believe not what happened last night laser tag."
"People freaked out because of a calibrated in suits who bothered their children?","Yeah, almost."
"Barney played laser tag with children. It takes a little girl in her arms and hides behind a phony.","Go! You want that!"
"My shoulder!","Come on."
"Stinson, in my office! Now!","Shit."
"Foul Play, three stampedes, and now this! Stinson, you are a ball!","I know, I'm not your precious rules, McCracken, but, damn, the results are there!"
"Listen, you're a good player laser tag. Perhaps the best I've seen. But someday, you will hurt someone.Maybe even you.","You forget what it's there. Your fat ass is stuck here for too long."
"McCracken is Enough You are banned, Stinson! Make your g*n and your badge!","My pleasure. Do not do that. This game is all I have.And I nearly enough tickets for the remote controlled helicopter. Pity."
"I can not believe I do that. But I'll leave you one last chance. But be aware, if you exceed the limits of a toe, you play the duck sh**ting in your mother's so fast it will make you dizzy. Get out!","You regret it."
"I can not believe you're kicked out of laser tag. Are you gonna do?","What shall I do? I'll tell you that Ted and I will do. We will introduce and apply the PQ everywhere."
"Barney, you're too old to put toilet paper because you can play laser tag more. And by the way, too old for laser tag.","Ted, laser tag has no age limit. As the striptease in the West Midlle."
"Yeah, whatever. I added laser tag to the list of Murtaugh.","No list of Murtaugh."
"At the apartment...","There's nothing on this list for which you're too old. In fact, if you did everything on the Murtaugh list, I would call it a nice weekend."
"Barney, you have more 18 years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge.","Challenge accepted. The next 24 hours, I will do everything on the list. And after that, you go to the PQ laser tag with me."
"And if you fail?","I'll spend three hours listening to you talk about architecture."
"An agreement of honor!","Come on guys, you do it!"
"There's some pretty hefty on the list. Finally, do you really think Barney is going to get ear pierced?","""To pierce the ear. ""Done. Well, I go to a laundry at my mother. Do you mind if I use your futon?"
"There is no futon.","Put it there, guys."
"What's the matter?","It's on the list. ""Landing on the futon with a friend rather than going to the hotel. """
"You got anything in your ear? It looks like the inside of a pumpkin after Halloween.","What, this? Just a quick foul '. Just a kid like me has to worry about. Then, ""pushing a medical"" on the list. Hold on. Bar here..."
"The next morning, Barney woke up on the futon in the living room.","Done. ""Drinking shots with strangers. ""Done."
"OK, Barney? You seem to have a bad back.","No, it's just the raver's hump. I like it. It brings me closer to my glass. A youth! You should have a straw?"
"Barney at the bar with Robin and Ted.","Hi, this is Barney."
"And Robin.","We can not answer because..."
"He watches football and I'm...","Part shopping. Leave a message, you are reminded..."
".. soon...",".. we..."
".. can!","""Making an autoresponder message to two annoying.""Done. It will probably cost me a few appointments, but it's okay."
"Your ear begins to feel.","It's good."
"Removes ""colonoscopy"" and ""sleeping with an old"", and is a cinch.","New bet, then. If you can finish your list before me, we will cover the laser PQ and you pay toilet paper.Biodegradable and not this crap. I want up there forever."
"Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good.","Bet held."
"""Put on reading glasses. ""Done. ""Yelled the boy from the neighborhood. ""With pleasure. What happened to you?","I just had a little ""screw up my knee and it hurts"" incident."
"How did you do?","It... ""Helped to move the sixth floor walk against pizza and beer."""
"Barney and Robin are at a rave.","Ted Calls. I want to go."
"Got up at 4am... Done.","It answers?"
"I have not called yet.","Hurry up, Robin."
"Okay. ""Take time to answer the phone. ""","Come on, Ted. I was given aspirin and I do not think it was."
"As a manager, I threw in the towel. This bet is over.Your ear looks like a Danish pastry in a French breakfast.","No, he remains a. ""The beer funnel. """
"Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem.","No, no. Okay. You won, I hate it. I hate it. My back is k*ll me. At the rave, I was mistaken for a cop. I have an earache so I can hear... I hear my own ear. Think about it. My clothes... What... Take that! I have redeemed you your best costume for twice its price. This is... $ 30. And throw the shoes. You won, Ted. I will not make anything of the Murtaugh list. I'm too old for this stuff."
".. that Murtaugh kept repeating: ""I'm too old for this stuff,"" but every time he says, he changes his mind, made another movie, and stuff. What I'm trying to say is that... the toilet, age.Will cover the PQ laser tag.","And then the hospital."
"My great... you cause me problems since you joined this club. But damn... if this is not the best battle of PQ I've ever seen. You are returned... And right away.","Really?"
"Ted, Barney and Marshall are at McClaren's and Lily joined them.","I heard a joke at work."
"Come on. She will not like it. It's funny for the guys, not girls.","It's sexist! When it's funny, it's funny. Lily's cool. She'll love it."
"Tell it.","Ready? What is the difference between jam and Nutella? It's funny."
"Lily leaves the bar.","Come on. It's funny. This is..."
"I told you so.","She'll be back."
"Barney comes to see that Marshall is in his office.","You know for layoffs?"
"Yes, I know. I tag. Are you worried?","Are you kidding? I know one thing about this company. I will never be fired. It is likely that one day I was stranded on a beach with no footprints or teeth, but I will not fire."
"I would like to have your insurance.","You just gotta find a way to make you absolutely critical."
"I work harder than anyone in my division.","Keep your job has nothing to do with being a hard worker. You need something."
"What do you mean something?","You know, something that makes you funny and loved, as Marcus Denisco."
"I love Chow-man. They can not fire him. You know what I like about Chow-man?","It's always food."
"It's always food.","You see? You need it. You need that thing that makes you a man."
"I have this thing that makes me a guy. Maybe even a guy and a half.","Not this stuff. You know, something. Toy-like man."
"That's great!","Claw tape!"
"I love Toy-man.","You see? You need something. Youtube-like man."
"You're right. I need something.","But choose wisely. You want to become the horrible man Massage."
"Marshall and Barney are in the conference room.","You filled it. Grub-man has a panna cotta in his office."
"Okay, but PJ does not help.","If Ted says that PJ is necessary to society, then PJ will go nowhere."
"You see? It is useful.","PJ is a guy? PJ, this is not a hottie you f*ck?"
"No, I guide him.","A Guide. I guided a young, once. I made him my co-pilot. Then one day, he hired an assistant to work 3 meters from her room, which... Check it out... is not a hottie, proving he has never listened. You know how to call this type?"
"Ted Mosby?","Maybe. I remember more. Because for me he is dead!(He rises) PJ will receive a mail with a disruptive place, it should in any circumstances be three days and then send it to me."
"I thought of something to become indispensable.The Ecolo-man! Everyone loves recycling, eh?","Fired. What else you got?"
"I have others. Ties-Fun-man.","Fired."
"Info-Unusual-man?","Did you know? Whether you're fired?"
"Stretch-man?","upside down Viré."
"The Monty-Python-man?","We are the knights who say... You're fired."
"Wait! I ran a simulation league baseball in school.","Not bad. You got maybe something."
"Great! Great! I Simulates-man!","Actually, you'll Sports-man. We have already Simulates-man."
"OK, guys?","Hi, Frank."
"Marshall is in his office when Barney comes to see.","Sports-man. I heard people talking about your club."
"Really, dude, I know not how long I'll keep.","Last week you were a waste that nobody was looking.Now you're Sports-man."
"A waste?","Last week!"
"This is our apartment. You let a cake on the counter, Mama's going to offer a slice.","I've told you, commits a pretty assistant with whom you can sleep instead of hiring an assistant with whom Robin sleeps. Of course he'll sleep with her. It is the coolest on the planet. I am off topic! You're an idiot! This is my message!You're an idiot! An angry person, that's not enough! Marshall with me!"
"Dude, why are you so upset that Ted does not sleep with the people he hires?","Because it hurts!"
"How so?","It hurts because I love... when Ted... layer with women. I am a very devoted friend! Lily is the only one I can talk. Tell him to talk to me."
"I'll try, but no warranty. She is still shocked by this joke. This joke. It tore our group, which turns the people I love against the other. Frankly, I would... I would like this joke is never entered our lives.","It's funny anyway, right?"
"You do not use this short-stop that the Mariners have discussed. I must have.","You see, Sports-man. People adore you."
"Apparently, Robin and PJ are together again.","You're kidding!"
"How are you?","As Lily not speaking to me, I must tell you something.And it's not easy to say, OK? I... wait... 'm... wait... love...wait... of... wait... a... wait... some... wait..."
"I know you're in love with Robin.","What?"
"Lily told me.","She told you? Great. I guess you marrez my back all this time."
"Actually, oddly, we both think you're meant for each other.","Really?"
"It even tries to sit on the same side for you to sit side by side.","Really? This is so cute. But let's be clear. I do not like it, OK? It's just that... I miss when she is not there. I think about her all the time, I guess one day we will run towards each other in slow motion and I wear a suede jacket."
"Tell her how you feel?","No. Perhaps. Ever. I know not. Listen... I just need to get rid of that idiot PJ. If Lily was there, she would know how to get rid of him."
"I can perhaps help you.","You're not Lily. Lily is a diabolical puppet master, the subtle situations to achieve its ends. This is evil incarnate. You have the right. Cling to it."
"I'll find something.","Hire the kid as his assistant. He does all the work and you're still Sports-man. Evil incarnate, Eriksen. Evil incarnate."
"Hey, Chow-man!","Hey, Toy-man!"
"Who's this guy?","He is not here. I think we should leave."
"I had the number of that girl. Look. Holly.","Owl. The girls with a name ending in LY are dirty.Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily."
"Yeah, it's true.","And not to mention the girls with names ending in I instead of a Y. These girls are like rides. You make the long tail, but once inside, you hold on, hoping not to lose your keys."
"You know what I'm going to do? I'll call on. I will do ""you remember me? It's been a "". It's funny because I just saw.","You can not. You must wait three days before calling.This is the rule."
"This rule is completely outdated. They know exactly what you do. I have another rule. It's a bit crazy, but I call it, ""you like him, you call him.""","Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the f*ck."
"My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?","Jesus."
"Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus.","Seriously. Jesus began this thing for three days. He waited three days to return to life. It was perfect. If he had waited one day we would not have known he was dead! They would have said: ""Jesus, are you? ""And Jesus would probably have said,"" You okay? I died yesterday! ""And they would say:"" You have the air alive, man. "" And they should explain his resurrection. And the miracle. And then the guy would say, ""Okay, whatever you want, dude."""
"The dialogues seem pompous old now.","And he will not come back on a Saturday. Everyone is busy doing chores. Weave, cut the beard. No. It looked exactly the right number of days... Three."
"I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking.","And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, ""No, Jesus died."" Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the ""tope there! ""3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story."
"Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards!","What?"
"You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?","We knew he would try to call three days before, so I took his cell phone and changed his number from mine."
"Marshall and Barney are at the bar.","""Piti texting""?"
"Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous.","Yeah. Or... it pretends to Holly and we are in the bath."
"It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us.","It should. Or... it is said that red is our favorite color and found the look ""cowboy"" sexy."
"I wear them right now and they are very sexy.","He put the boots!"
"He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears.","Or... we remove our shirts."
"It's better.","Maybe that door below, a black bra with lace."
"I believe that wearing anything underneath.","It is hot."
"There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go!","Too! Tell him we slowly drag our... What do we do?"
"No, actually it was for his good. It protects it from itself. He really likes this girl. He had that look.","The crazy eyes, ""I'm going too fast and I will f*ck up everything."""
"The same he had with you the first time.","We all know what it gave."
"It's been that Ted did not like someone. He stored much... We thought him to say ""I love you"" when he contacted her.","And it's coming. It shows all the telltale signs."
"First: he jokes with the marriage.","""You like architecture? We should get married. Ha-ha.MDR. Just kidding. So what? """
"Deuzio: it's far too early suggestions crazy travel.","""I like beer. We should go to Germany. MDR. JP.MDR. """
"Third: it says too early personal things.","""My parents divorced two years there. It was really hard. MDR. """
"Yeah, but that's the problem. Ted did not say ""I love you"" as easily as we thought.","And then we met Stan."
"Super Stan. Who is it?","A guard who works nights."
"He eats here every day.","And he had not finished."
"It's... really nice.","No matter. It's OK."
"I do not know... what comes to the bread here, but it touches me... here... and here.","Well, if Ted does not say, I will. I love you."
"It is perhaps not in love with us.","How is this possible? It's all there waiting!"
"That guy you fell in love. I hope his girlfriend is not jealous. He spoke of a friend or...?","All was well until he sends a text message for Lily and ruins everything."
"It's okay. It's over now. I have to leave, but that's what happens: you call it now, tell him what you did and apologize.Got it?","Yes. Or..."
"He replied! ""I probably should not tell you, finally, we barely knew, but never mind, I say it anyway. ""","That's it, man. This is the ""I love you."""
"I would like Stan to be there.","Stan. What?"
"""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend.""","""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend. """
"Ted Why send text messages to a girl he barely knows, where he says he dreams about me gay?","Easy. You? He speaks clearly to me."
"Dude, I'm his best friend.","Okay, one: It has never been proven. Two: If anyone had any dreams about gays one of us would be on me! Finally, look at me. Now look at you. An octogenarian still in her closet would not be in this state."
"That's the trick. I hug you, no. Who would not want to cuddle in this case, on Sunday morning? Wrapped in the quilt while it is raining, and there are muffins in the oven. I'm cuddly, bitch. You must do.","I train every day. One thing we know about Ted is that he likes a nice body. This body would vibrate."
"Ted and I, we lived. I know what he likes. There are things I can do it... he époustoufleraient Why do they sleep with Ted?","I know. It's weird."
"Barney and Marshall are in McClaren's with Robin.","Crazy, no? Ted had dreams about me gay."
"It's a bit weird, but... I had a strange dream yesterday. It's a bit embarrassing.","You can tell us. This is a secure area."
"That's it?","No more dreams? Nothing disturbing or erotic?"
"And.. why should I ""make me"" one of you?","Machines force you. They want to watch. That's how they erupt."
"Sorry. It was just trying to help you.","And also, it was really funny."
"Hi, friends.","You work right?"
"Wait. You can not just sit there and have your date with us?","Yeah, it will be fun! Look, I'm kidding! It explodes! Do you like magic?"
"Someone has already put on YouTube?","Yeah... someone. So... why did you vomit? You're pregnant?"
"Barney at the bar and reads a magazine. He returned to the apartment to see Ted.","The Bro's Life magazine. Page 83. Look."
"""What does your paintball on your personality? ""","Lowest."
"""The last 3 kilos: how the push to lose. ""","Highest."

"You are my hero! Really? How did you do?","It's not in the story. I waited a long time to say that.This girl... is the daughter."
"Of course it is. Marry them! It.","Marrying? I have something even more special in mind. Petra, if all goes well, will be my... wait, my 200th! Can not wait. Too exciting."
"The 200th with that... get laid?","Who I'll lie. I want the highest ""Tope there."""

"200 is too much.","It's not too much."
"It's not too much.","Thank you."
"Do not misunderstand. You're disgusting and the cops should put a shoe on your part, but this number should be higher. After Barney told me about that, I reviewed the figures and... I have some graphics. Barney dredge about 20 girls a week.","It's more than 20. B. Does nothing more precise estimate."
"Let 20. So 20 girls a week, that's 1,040 girls a year.In its 16 years of sexual activity, it would mean that he has dredged 16,640 girls. If he has slept with 199, it's a success rate... slightly higher than one per cent. This is an average of 12 hits, eight times worse than average in career... launcher in one hand, the launcher... Jim Abbott.","Jealous. Jealous. Hero. Strangely silent during this conversation on his number of sexual partners. Hero. The grand total, it is the only number that matters."
"Who said so?","Matthew Panning, the stud of Port Richmond College."

"How many times I have to tell you? I did it with 100 girls. Fifth in school from my cousin in Long Island.","You know what, Matthew? One day, I would have done with 200."
"Call me when it happens.","And I'll call."
"I think he'll say it again very slowly.","I will... the call."
"You have noted Gaby Allan dual, 78 and 162.","What? Let me see. Sixty... Once. Oh, my God. Wait...I counted the same girl twice? That means I'm only at 198?"
"It just means you're less than 0.5% was thought disgusting.","I win a Czech supermodel in two hours. I can not waste it in the 199th. Petra must be the 200th."
"are you gonna do? You will find not a partner in the next 2 hours.","Astronaut Millionaire. You come home to see shells?"
"You're scary.","You're not as sick of all these games? I just want to settle down and have an army of toddlers at once."
"I have a mass and I love to use it.","Marshall? Knowing how important it is for me, you think that Lily... I would do the job..."
"I'll k*ll you.","Okay."
"Barney returns.","It's done. 199 made of, more than one. Have you finished your drink? That's better."
"It has happened to you what?","There... a girl in the gym. Pauline. She runs after me for a while."
"Why wait till then?","It's not really my type."
"At the gym...","Good, Pauline. You're going to have all of Fonte Leveuse Sarasota Classic this fall. I thought... to you and me.And if you're still interested..."
"Ok, this is the hour of cardio.","Good grief! Mom!"
"Good grief! Mom!","Every inch tasted like roast beef and creatine. But I did. I did and I still have 30 minutes before meeting with Petra.Robin, you have the foundation? I want to cover bruises and razor burn."
"I hate to tell you this, but...","What?"
"You did the right Gaby Allan counted 2 times, but...you're also spent 138 to 138. Have you used the same number twice.","So that means... Pauline is not the 199th, it is the 200th?"
"Congratulations!","It must have Petra! Petra was to be the 200th!Beautiful, feminine, ""unrestrained power in bed"", Petra!"
"Go! Happened to you at 200. You should be proud. You should be tested, but you should be proud. We do not care if Pauline does not pose in bikinis in magazines.","It does. She will be in the next Muscle Sexxy. And like many women in this magazine, Sexxy has two X and one Y."
"That's enough tables.","What about the graphics."
"I'm not stupid. I know what you think of my paintings and graphics. In fact, I made a picture of your reactions to my paintings. See it. Yes, that's true, since Cecilia, your interest in my paintings do not stop falling. But based on recent trends, I also... projection boards! And look... a large peak of interest is coming!

"Marshall and Barney gets up applauding.","Well played, sir."
"I think you've been great.","I would say even more. You, sir, did think Stella. ""Ted looked so cool now. Do I chose the wrong? ""Wait a week. The bush on the back. And belly. Have you felt that? There was an earthquake ""Tope-there""."
"Tony is rich? Tell me that you wrote a check. Tell me that you did a very big check. So big that he not remove his shirt to go swimming.","It's a very big check. IF big, that if you sleep with, you would not tell your friends."
"It's...","A very big check!"
"I will not be a professor. That's what you do when your career is in trouble and you have to pay the bills. Manager of small business. The lung of the economy. I will not take this job, okay? I'll get through. New topic.","Okay. Today, I had a $ 200 fine for speeding."
"That sucks, dude. You did not manage to blow it up?","You can not blow a fine."
"Handling a police officer with your sausage. It's sexy.","You think I can not blow a fine? You think I can not blow my fine? I am Barney Stinson, master of manipulation. If I managed to make me pay for a stripper to dance, I can blow a fine. Challenge accepted... wait."
"Barney is driving his car.","Let's go."
"Driver and vehicle registration.","Of course, officer. On."
"Sir, this is a gift certificate for a custom Italian suit.","So, what's good?"
"Barney arrives at the bar.","$ 375! And he kept the gift certificate. Emilio and I'll call him tell him to shorten the crotch."
"You're wrong about that, man.","Anything, Robin. Like you've already blown a fine."
"While the others are at the bar, Barney is in his car and is still off.","Come on. Mr. Officer, please, my wife is having a baby! She just lost the waters!"
"Where is your wife?","She took the other car. It's Italian leather, so... I... go..."
"Barney is stopped on the roadside.","OK, you can do it. You can do it! You can do it."
"Driver and...","Licensing and registration papers."
"Pardon?","You must have a permit to be as pretty. And this body? I imagine that something as expl*sive must be registered with the authorities."
"Exit the vehicle.","Why, am I under arrest?"
"It's from a porno. I saw him. Shit, I did.","When will you understand the difference between my life and a porno is that my life has better lighting."
"You're lying.","I'm not lying! I swear on my mother. I swear Goliath National Bank. I swear on my costumes. I... do... mens... not."
"Ted's phone rings.","It's me! This is Barney. With the help! I have big problems!"
"Slow down. What's going on?","I imagine that something as expl*sive must be registered with the authorities."
"Yes, I did a search. You have 15 offenses of the past three days. Exit the vehicle.","No, my wife will give birth! I have a sausage with your name!"
"I'm a little busy.","Come on. You have no idea what kind of criminals with whom they put me."
"Let's get our painting?","Save me, Ted!"
"Stella in the car...","By the way, how's the girl you see? This superb French with huge tits?"
"You talk about Claudette? She is fine.","The highest good of all those with whom you're never out! Ever!"
"In McClaren's...","She was found two days later, in the directory. I've never put my name in my underwear."
"Lily joined them.","You're back!"
"When listening to this joke of peanut butter and jam, I was completely disgusted. But this morning in the shower, I thought about it and it made me laugh. Peanut butter. So I think I could win. According to Marshall.","It's good to see you, Lily."
"Thank you. So what's new?","I'm in a world of amnesia with lots of pictures of my son and an alliance. I will find the best woman / woman and we will..."
"Barney enters the apartment where Ted is still trying to design a building.","What are you doing?"
"A hat-shaped building.","It's time to talk?"
"I have to really work, so...","Awesome. Say that is a tailor and you have found a nice suit. A nice suit Canada. Superb chest. You try it, but it does not suit you perfectly. So you return it. Then I try it. I'm not too keen... a suit that you have caught the eye, but at the same time, I love this costume."
"Buy the costume. It is important to you. Tell him how you feel.","But Ted, remember your answer, because... The costume is Robin. I know! Okay?"
"I'm with you.","Now. As I explained..."
"Ted, Marshall and Barney are on the roof with an inflatable pool.","Forget it. It really is not class. At best, it sucks."
"It looks to be a... sacred... spa.","Owl. How do we go? We will do what? Jump?"
"An hour later... Marshall is always on the edge of the roof while Ted and Barney are in the pool.","Actually, it's not bad."
"This is the permission I needed.","Look, Robin... I must tell you something."
"Wait. Before that, I must tell you something.","What is it?"
"You said what?","In your opinion? What we can say to that?"
"You must be right. Have fun.","You too, sweetie."
"You were in love with her, throughout the year and when she feels the same, you love him more.","It's not great?"
"It is. It... is... go! It is.","Tracey, tell Lily what you just said."
"What I just arrived in New York?","No, how you've arrived there."
"I just get off the bus from Iowa.","Come off the bus from Iowa! How lucky that apprentice... dancer off the bus from Iowa... meeting... the producer of the Rockettes?"
"Honey, you're there. You're really there.","You can make us one of those rum and beer, that your father loves so much?"
"Damn.","What?"
"Everyone always says, ""Do not tell Lily. Lily can not keep a secret. ""And, usually, they are right. But this time I kept the secret. And here you come with that crap and you force me to become the Lily will spill the beans!","What song? There was a piece?"
"That's it. It worked well. You are back to normal.","Yes. It's true. And it's great. It's great. So Robin does not like me."
"Ted leaves the room followed by Marshall and Lily.","So... You're in love with me?"
"What? Yes. Much.","You can stop. Lily told me everything."
"Damn, Lily!","I can not believe it."
"It's just... You mean to me, Barney. And... This kind of stuff, the emotional side. This is not your type. I thought you avoid that.","Maybe I will not avoid it. I am perhaps. I have not wanted for a long time. But with you, it does not look so...difficult. I know not. I thought... you felt the same."
"Maybe. I know not. I am not good to face the feelings.There is clearly something... between us. Maybe my head said, ""stifles it in the bud"" because my heart said... something else. Listen... I feel for you. Maybe even that I love you.","It's going pretty fast, do not you think?"
"Friends.","My God. You just do it again. You've mosbysé!"
"But no.","But if, little flirtatious."
"You're right. I've just mosbyser.","Why are you scared to try?"
"Because I'm afraid of how I could love you.","Bad idea."
"You're right. There must be a mistake.","No."
"I love you.","Friends."
"Friends, then.","I love you."
"Let's get married.","No, you're smothering me."
"They kiss.","You know what? We'll see later."
"I'll tell you, I will eat more chops.","Yeah, right."
"Lily slips a note under the door.","I know, right?"
"Barney joins him.","I hate to be the one to tell you. Marshall and Lily get divorced."
"No problem.","I gotta go."
"There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.","They have a big problem."
"I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... ""little known"" because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever.","If, when you're great like me. Listen to this. Robin taking into account the number of beds in which we did. One is 83 and a half."
"And a half?","An Ottoman 19th in an antique shop."
"What's new?","Big Tiger. You holding up? Want a hug? You mean yesterday? You're safe here."
"Why? Lily loves a clean sink so I do the dishes right away, what's the problem?","I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily."
"Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a k*ll foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue.","Let me ask you a question."
"Go ahead.","Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes?"
"Not really.","So what is the problem of Lily, not yours."
"But if I said that, we will play, so...","You argue. Robin, we do not fight."
"Of course I do.","No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue..."
"So when you think you will play and you get up you go?","It works in 100% of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said."
"I can not believe Robin supports it.","Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments."
"But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed.","There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily."
"Go to the basics!","Okay."
"Flash","Thank you, doll."
"Honey, you're going to wash it?","I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, ""Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel"" is what you will paint the?"
"No. Of course not.","Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing."
"Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.","It's because you're a woman."
"I do not even know why we laugh!","Of course not."
"Wait, Ted. Listen to the man.","Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy a*tillery."
"Lily and Barney are sitting on the couch.","Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes."
"She lowers the light and dance in a way... sexy.","Now, turn around."
"No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003.","The piercing was cool."
"I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it!","You're welcome."
"I think that's true.","I told you."
"How was the trip?","Okay."
"What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting?","It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually?"
"We all came out a year.","short, and your weekend?"
"I do not know what happened. I am a lawyer. I earn my living by arguing but when it is with Lily, I'm... confused. How not to be with her eyes and her breasts?","What happened to the ""I'm tired after my exhausting day and I want to use what little energy I have left to cover you with love""?"
"Dude, Lily is played badly. It is small... but as a vicious badger that your brother would have caught and starved for 5 days and placed in your sleeping bag. I should go and apologize.","You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal. Not having to tie your T-shirt to form a bowl of salted fortune for your pleasures. This world belongs to you, Marshall.Beach house, take it, put yourself in holiday clothes, benefits."
"This dish is my manhood! And I want to leave my manhood deep in the dirty sink full of ketchup and pasta...","What do you eat?"
"Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer.","Hey, Ro-Ro."
"Nothing. We're just happy.","As Gandhi said, ""A smile costs nothing, baby."""
"Barney, Robin and Ted are at McLaren's.","How will Marshall and Lily?"
"Those two worry me, really.","You and your big, huge heart."
"Enough. The game is over.","What do you mean by that?"
"Phil told me.","Who the hell is Phil?"
"And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?","All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend."
"Barney and Robin are in a chairlift.","I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two."
"It's your board that is zero.","You're on the side of Lily? You... No. We will argue and I can not spin."
"I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic.","Or so I tried the jump?"
"Or just the pants?","This trick of dodging is over?"
"I think.","You have the? This is the smallest!"
"All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties.","The tie m*rder by Robin."
"The hidden camera in the headboard.","As a quarterback to stay on top. Monday morning, he sits on an ice pack and are studying the tape of the match."
"I knew it! I knew you were too cute and perfect!","Look, we were fed up everyone to tell us how we are no relations."
"It sounds and Marshall will open.","We need advice."
"Barney and Robin laugh.","More important than winning."
"Barney and Robin go.","What about now?"
"I think we should talk about advantage and get down to business.","Or, there is a bench in the elevator."
"That's better. It is not the best couple in the world, so what?","Grave. It's not a competition."
"In 2008... The band is at McLaren's.","Your girlfriend? This is your girlfriend!? It is small and it's your friend? Do not humanize the enemy. But, delighted."
"Marshall, Lily, Barney, Ted and Robin are at the apartment of the latter.","Come on. Open it. It's p*rn collection! Just kidding. It would be weird."
"It's your p*rn collection.","This is my collection of p*rn! I offer you my p*rn. Now that it goes really well with Robin, I need more."
"This is obvious.","What does that mean?"
"Nothing, it's just, you know, you have love handles.","What?! I have no love handles. This is ridiculous."
"He really is growing at a time.","We gotta go. Goodbye, my dear friends. You were always there for me. We will miss you."
"ArchiSexture.","If you watch this tape, and I knew it... is that you are in possession of all my p*rn. It can only mean two things, either I'm dead or I'm in a committed relationship. If I died, I want you honor my memory by taking my body in the Hamptons and recreating Weekend at Bernie. I want to dance. I want to make love. And I want to go fishing. If, on the other hand, I'm in a relationship, as best friend, I have one favor to ask. Please, for God's sake, get me out of here!"
"I wanted to go to a concert. Him at a party. We could obviously do what the other wanted, so we stayed to watch a movie on cable.","It was Legen... wait... the Autumn. Legends of the Fall!It was fun."
"I spotted this girl there, and I will need help to land the plane.","Sorry, I have my own way tonight."
"How do you go?","Super. Relations are deadly..."
"Shut up...","Monogamy is the best."
"Shut up.","Tagline!"
"But it got worse... more","More hungry..."
"Robin and Ted meet Barney, Marshall and Lily at the bar but they are obese.","I can... in a minute."
"Marshall and Barney are the McLaren's and Barney is still eating.","Did you notice that the beef ribs were absolutely disgusting, but recently they have become delicious?"
"I'll get to the point, and ask you a question. Are you happy with Robin?","Are you kidding?! How could I not be? It's Robin!"
"So you're happy?","And you know what happens right after a fight? Gender reconciliation. What is different... when you're in a loving and lasting relationship."
"Barney and Robin are in bed.","Stack we make love, we order a pizza face and it stays there to moan."
"He throws the room.","What was the pizza again?"
"Face.","It's face."
"Please, shut up.","What?"
"I thought you had mentioned, sorry. This is an engagement ring?Are you...?","No, this is not one. They had the wrong table. You can imagine we are married?"
"We're committed to one another.","Your business is already in my apartment."
"Easier for taxes.","And for your naturalization."
"""Scherbatsky"" is hard to spell.","My mother would be so happy."
"Yeah, I guess.","No reason not to do so."
"The band is back at the bar.","We get married!"
"You do not know any that girl over there?","No, I do not think. No, actually, I do not know... This is Meg. I do not compare in my mind there. Can you pick me?"
"You're not a bit old for that stupid doll?","It's not a doll. It's a stormtrooper."
"He wears a diaper.","No, it's protective armor."
"A stormtrooper? Rather a storm-merdeur.","Come on."
"It looks like your storm-merdeur the changes we need.","You know, I'm sick."
"I said nothing.","The jokes about magic, the stormtrooper..."
"In McLaren's...","Really..."
"You know Neil Young is my favorite musician.","She was the wife of Archie in All in the family, or the same voice?"
"Neil Young is a Canadian treasure. Do not make fun of Neil Young.","I never make fun of an old lady paralyzed vocal cord..."
"Look at us. It is horrible all the time like that?","I'm not happy. Finally, I would be. Nothing would make me happier than to be happy, but... I'm not."
"What are we doing wrong? We love. If it does not work, what then? We are so similar.","We love scotch. It is awesome."
"That might be it. There may be too great there.","Exactly. Two awesome cancel out, and... I'm tired of being canceled."
"Me too. We separate?","I think. Shit. Following happens. After which you and I can not become friends again."
"It's a stormtrooper?","It's not a stormtr... We're going from here?"
"They kiss before leaving the restaurant.","And then who knows? Maybe in 40 years, if you have not found anyone..."
"I am already involved with Ted.","It's true. Thin. Maybe in 39 years, if you have not found anyone..."
"Barney enters the McLaren's and everyone turns around. He again became slim.","Dad returned."
"Clip? The video for ""Sandcastles""! It was also this together.","What do you mean ""too""?"
"While others are dedicated solely to...","All women of New York. That's right, Barney Stinson is back on the market. Mother, lock your daughters. Daughters, lock your MAQACENJaR."
"Wait, I can find. With Mothers Who I'd like Sunset And Never Forgot.","You have the right answer!"
"You're not rush a little, then?","Since I went out with Robin there is a trick that I have not used as much as I wanted. It is... rather large, surprisingly heavy, with the skin, and it's black. My friends, this is the book of... Roles."
"You're writing another book? Stephen King was one right there.","It's all there. Everything, starting from the basic, like Le Bois Do Not Ca..."
"At MacLaren's, Barney keeps women from drinking his glass.","Do not drink it. I saw a guy put something."
"What? Who?","This guy."
"What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?","Glad you asked."
"I had put aside for Ted Shelly for 3 years.","My hen, Ted did not miss much. She is brainy, boring, a bit boring in bed. In fact it would have been perfect for Ted.Oops! If I had known she was there for Ted, I would have obviously not done, but... given the circumstances, I think Ted would be proud of me. I managed The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn."
"Barney is on his computer.","To achieve the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn is what you need, basic knowledge in web design and a truly unique fake name. So think about your fake name right away. You? Fine.Now choose your target. Yeah that's me."
"I know you?","I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn."
"You are, kind known?","Yes. You do not know who I am, does not it? It feels good for once. Nice to meet you..."
"Shelly.","Shelly? Again, I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. It is written as it is pronounced, with two ""T"". I hate to be cheeky, but I can offer you a coffee?"
"Yes! Please.","How much is a coffee today, $ 50? And here we go."
"It's horrible. You realize you've broken her heart? She is inconsolable.","Why would it be inconsolable? The airship of Lorenzo will not disappear in the Arctic for a week. Sorry if this is that someone told her that it was lies."
"Lies!","Oh my God! Well, I hope you are pleased with you."
"Me?","You! She will never trust a man. You've spoiled for Ted.Not to mention Julio Von Matterhorn, the twin brother of Lorenzo."
"You're an astronaut?","Actually, I'm in a top secret government space program called Secret NASA... Sn&aring;sa."
"Sn&aring;sa? You went to the moon and everything?","No Moon you know, but I went on Slune."
"Well, Barney, you go out... You just get out of a sincere relationship. You're a big boy now. You can return to your towers to two euros.","Tours to two euros?! None of these towers is. The Tower A except two Euros."
"Barney is dressed and speaks with a woman.","I am the bassist for Tower Two Euros. And even that involves expensive hair extensions. Now, if you allow, I have to prepare for the event tonight. The I exécuterais he will not come.Glad you asked."
"~ THE THERE WILL NOT ~","The To run it will not come, you will need the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Got it? Fine. For generations, this is the place chosen by New Yorkers for reunion with their lost lovers of view, you need to go to every girl and say, ""He will not come."""
"What happened?","I tried the he will not come, and it worked. Monstrous.You should have seen this girl."
"Robin fate.","So, we came up to me, and I go to my room to prepare the camera... lighting candles... and when I go out, nobody, paper and more roles! We all know who is responsible for that."
"Yes, we know.","Al-Qaeda."
"No, you idiot. That was me.","You... enfoirée dirty!"
"At Ted's apartment...","An actress. Of course. That explains his perfect diction and style of Drag."
"I'm almost to the point of taking this book and put it on the net for everyone to see.","You would not dare."
"No, as you stop scams and confidence tricks, deception, underhand, tricks, schemes and embobinages.","You did not say nonsense."
"No more nonsense!","Slim."
"Barney pretends to Ted with a woman.","I was abandoned at the altar."
"Really? A genie comes out?","Only if you rub hard enough."
"Apparently, it will rain.","If you wonder, I would be at McLaren's playing a character from the Book of roles being called The Diver. That's all."
"Ted, Robin, Marshall and Lily have joined Barney at the bar.","Now you want to know what the diver. In fact, it was on the last page of the Book, but I pulled in case. But do not worry.You will see it in action. You see the blonde next to the bar?Cizzible repérizzée."
"Barney, no. You are...","Forget it, kid. If anyone should be angry with me, this is Robin. She loves the book."
"I did not worship the book.","But what...? The Book of the Rolls, this is gold. Granted this is truly spectacular."
"We just broke. The costumes are nice, but... it just broke.","I did not know you felt it. I was so caught up with my own projects as... Damn, she looks out there. Quickly dispersed."
"So what does the diver? Claire and here, in passing.","Hello, Claire. I am Lieutenant Frank Lyman. I train dolphins b*mb detectors for... You know what? I can not do that.Robin, I'm sorry. I think this break is harder for me than expected.The Book of roles was just a way to change my mind."
"I'm delighted that you stop it. And frankly, the real Barney is better than all the false Barney's Book of Roles.","Is it true? Claire, you must have heard a lot about the real Barney tonight. Want some coffee?"
"Before refusing, you should know that in this neoprene combined with what appears to be a pair of socks...","A Pringles, but still."
"Marshall takes Robin and Ted in his arms.","It was a team effort."
"Yes, and you know why? Because I love you. And I'll show you how. Ted Mosby and Robin Scherbatsky, I bring you... the fourth slap.","Wait. What?"
"Certainly not. Unless you were thinking... ""Baffegiving two: Revenge of the lower"" in this case, yes, that's what I'm saying!","The slaps are not transferable."
"Awesome.","Absolutely not!"
"Me too. She speaks little, but that thing with his father gave him much trouble.","Tell me which of you is going to slap me!"
"Do not underestimate. You're a rock star of slaps. Your name should be Eric Baffe-PTON.","This is torture. Put me in the chair..."
"The Throne of Baffe.","And finish it!"
"No, not at all.","This is interesting."
"Let me do it. It was my idea to call the objects found in the prefecture.","It's a good point. Rebuttal?"
"I slipped a note of the type 20!","philosophical riddle. Idea against execution. Itemize your arguments."
"You have to let it calm down. Finish the game.","Repeat-a. The first seven!"
"It's decided. Barney, go. Come on the throne.","You're gonna..."
"Yep. Go.","I guess this is the best choice, Robin. Finally... the men are stronger than women."
"Do not listen. It's decided.","And that's what you always wanted, is not it? A strong man to take care of you? Of course, teenager, you were a feisty, playing hockey with the boys, you skinned your knees on the ice. But what you could say to your teammates... or even to yourself... that is all you really wanted was this pretty white dress in this beautiful white chapel. And at the end of the aisle strewn with pretty white flowers, a man to take care of all your slaps."
"Everyone. Before we begin, Barney, we'll need you on the throne of Baffe.","Commissioner of the bet-Baffe, tie me to the chair is a violation..."
"I know.","It's downright hell."
"Robin is about to slap...","It hurts!"
"I do not either.","thank you God."
"So, I want to move. Mickey?","No way!"
"It stretches and then...","Gently!"
"I'm sorry. I can not do it.","thank you God."
"I know I have not been a good father.","You're kidding me."
"So for all dance recitals that I missed, for all the art exhibitions that I should attend... for the wedding that I was not able to offer you... I give you, to you This slap.","No. No, no, no, no. It is the Commissioner of the bet-Baffe. It must remain impartial!"
"The Commissioner of the bet-Baffe says it's good.","It's not good. Please... Let me..."
"It warms the hand and stops.","I'm running in a meadow."
"Because... the slap did exactly what I hoped. It brought us together. And it forced us to recognize the weakness and at the same time the greatness in ourselves and in others.","Stop your bullshit."
"It separates the Barney ""Throne"".","This is the best Thanksgiving..."
"Lily.","That girl over there."
"We went to college together, she's great. Everybody liked him.","Oh I know what we do here. Tell me when it stops."
"And now, a single and Maggie is available along the way to this bar right now. I made him take a taxi with a woman driver for there is no interaction with a man, so far.","Even when I arrived here, she still will not touch with a man. I feel good tonight, this evening will be well."
"She's right baby, if you had worn it in college, even I would not have slept with you. And if you remember, I wanted to.","No way, no one could sleep while wearing it. Challenge accepted. I, Barney Stinson, brilliant mind in an extraordinary body, this will overalls, and lie with a woman."
"Your challenge not interest me but you're cheating. Wear a suit under the overalls.","No. They are called not on the shirt, or on t-shirts for wholesale repairing the car and my mother spent some time with her top. They are called overalls, and I can relate to what I want."
"Bizarre as drinking game.","I offer you a drink?"
"It was a big tractor 3-axis.","What do I do?"
"You let him with Barney?","Ted, will you calm down? I'm your pal!"
"You're an animal!","And I know our relationship has suffered in this area, I assure you I'll be the perfect gentleman."
"Thank you! In fact, I love this bib!","You have 10 minutes to get here, the window closes."
"10 minutes?","Yeah, because we're friends!"
"How could you?","I'm challenged to have sex with overalls. And if you stay on my path, then you let Barney win. And you do not want that!This place will never tell us the end of history."
"Put yourself on the line Bob!","Yeah, I'll sleep with her. After, he'll tell her he loves her.And you can do... what you want. Is there agreement on the order?"
"I'm in love with her for 12 years!","I wear this jumpsuit since 1:30!"
"We continue to negotiate until we have a very small window of opportunity.","Guys, let me assure you that if you let me... the window will reopen in about 10 minutes."
"There was never a next time. The window of Maggie never reopened.","Well, I found! There are bars country, ""the giddy ups"", there are tons of guys in overalls. Copilot me!"
"I do not want the ""giddy ups."" That's what I want. I had forgotten how it felt to seeking the real thing... but I think I'm ready again.","Let me tell you where I am... I want to sleep with a girl in order to remove this jumpsuit. Go, go. You gotta help me, I have to remove this damn thing."
"Marshall, Barney and Ted entered the apartment while Robin does his gym.","I just let something like that to my apartment."
"So that's why you're worried?","The new head of legal department is Hobes Arthur."
"Wow, he not remember you.","Not great, it does not matter that Arthur Hobes not like Marshall, he loves no one. It is the people he knows that he has to separate. He just fired, ""What's his head? ""."
"Look, I understand you to be upset but this is not a reason to k*ll you.","Yeah, after you turn'm doing... then you can k*ll you. As ""What is his head? "". Now I think it is, where is his head?"
"I can not believe they're smoking outside, it's really cold.","Do you remember when you could smoke in bars?"
"I think there's a pretty girl smiling at me there.","Hey, this is a chair, but go ahead and drag it."
"Our group is divided into smokers and nonsmokers, and it's great.","You're right. Going for a smoke."
"Hey you two, smoking, like us.","I'm not a smoker. I do not smoke on certain occasions.After sex, when I'm with German, sometimes both at the same time. During sex, for birthdays, to annoy my mother, just before sex, on a sailboat. The day the mentor MC mailly eliminated each year, and of course... wait, because God knows it's true: fear of pregnancy."
"And why you smoke there?","I'm always on the verge of sleep Ted."
"Maybe that smoking is not so bad, at least it is outdoors.","And my abs muscle nicotine. I... am... muscular."
"Ted, Barney, Lily and Marshall are on the roof of the apartment to smoke.","My God, I hope that Arthur is well. I reserve her office in case."
"Marshall, Lily and Ted put out the cigarette. Only Barney keeps his.","I'm proud of you guys. I heard how it was difficult to stop smoking for as you, then the part of non-smokers, I tell you hat, so give me your cigarettes and I rid, one at a time."
"I can not stop now, not before the most important interview of my life. It's too stressful.","It's too stressful!"
"Barney stops eating your fingers.","I do not bite my nails, I try to suck the rest of nicotine on my fingers."
"What, you're a dinosaur?","What do cigarettes now? You believe they think of us?"
"We will not smoke.","I have a hiding on the roof."
"They get up and go on the roof. Robin arrives.","Oh, I woke up and I smoke. Robin, you know how it's dangerous to wake a smoker sleeps."
"You know it's the perfect time there. For one last cigarette. The real last.","Come on, let's do it."
"She wants to do a doctorate, she reads the philosophy for fun, she finished the crossword in the Sunday New York Times.","Ted, I am happy for you. Sorry, not for you, not to be you."
"Why it's almost that guys?","Only two things can cause this turmoil."
"Ted, Robin, Lily and Barney are down at the bar where all the guys at the counter.","Ladies and gentlemen, the McLaren's hired a sexy barmaid."
"We'd better find a new bar.","What... are you crazy? It's a sexy barmaid. Do you know how long I've waited for me... My friends, I slept with many women in my glory days. Lawyers, professors, poets, doctors, professional riders, and animators... A butcher, a baker, a candle maker. Yes, we got to the part where it rhymes. A teacher, a restorative, an observer... A puppeteer, a croupier, a housewife, it is also a job, guys. A circuit court judge..."
"Abbreviates!","I never, never slept with a barmaid sexy, until tonight."
"No. Shut up!","Wish me luck."
"It will never happen. She will pretend to enjoy yourself in the same way she has mesmerized all these geniuses.","Guess who will not fall under his spell? I will make him ""Do not try, baby. Papa needs a gin and tonic. ""And when she will, I recracherai saying"" Do it again. "" The dominant male where it should be: on top, and after a few minutes below. Why should I do anything?"
"What do you want?","Do not even try, baby. Wait, what?"
"You're going to stay there in order to be ridiculous?","Uh..."
"Yeah, I'm gay. Gay for you.","No matter. You understand why I'm the only guy she does not know this bar?"
"Summer 2009, Barney skied in costume.","True... But for these two... And, for that... Finally, for her... I'll stop wearing, wait..."
"Sorry to have misjudged you. If there is a kind of men I can not stand are those in costume. Ca, and a woman who does not comply.","The costumes and complexed. I hate them. I hate them."
"We will order food.","I arrive in a second."
"Sorry, Barney. There is nothing more to do.","So young. You can not do anything else?"
"No. But we can use the buttons on this costume to another.","It can... As an organ donor?"
"The death of this suit could save the life of another.","But I... Do it."
"You do what it takes. Do not cry about it. It's silk.","Sorry. I know. I know."
"Barney joined Marshall, Lily, Ted and Robin at the bar, with an urn in his hands.","We have the remains cremated. Its buttons have saved a sick jacket of the Upper East Side."
"Finally, you can abandon the quest for so-called sexy barmaid.","No. My costume gave his life for this cause, and I do not should rest before these two... Well, it... Finally,... Be it mine."
"Barney, sorry about your friend. Tell me about him.","It was Italian. Classic, elegant. And my God he knew how to deal with women. They could not say no."
"How old was he?","7 years. I miss him so much!"
"You should not be alone tonight. I will finish earlier.","Thank you, old friend. You go on a good sh*t."
"Barney the bartender back home.","It was so special, you know? We should observe a minute of silence. Followed by about 20 minutes of grunting."
"I'll help you feel much better. Let me refresh.","Okay. Expected. No, this is not the bathroom. This is..."
"They are yours?","I'm the suit-sitting for someone."
"Oh, really! Then answer these questions, I beg. What would you do if you had to choose between your suits and a pot of gold?","Costumes!"
"What would you say, against all your costume you were offered eternal youth?","Costumes!"
"What would you choose: a million girls and one three parts?","Do we see."
"And a world at peace would be within your reach?","I'll stop. These are the costumes. Stops just bullshit.Two, three, four! Girls come and depart, but the clothes remain constant! Each buddy dépote and rambling, it is no substitute!Sorry, my costumes, I give you my life. My Sunday clothes are my best friends! The casual clothes go in the basket because nothing goes better with the undisputed often praised, claiming to fame... a true... Expect more... Costume..."
"Nothing suits her better... than... Costume.In costume! In costume! Costume...!","Mind you, it is rather barrel. I choose you you, baby. Tomorrow morning, I get rid of these costumes."
"You want to sleep with Jenkins?","With Jenkins, of Jenkins, near Jenkins. You said it, I want to put like a sock."
"But um, it would seem, she often said.","It's funny, I also had a drinking game based on Robin, Robin finally. At the bottom of her stomach..."
"It was agreed that you do not speak of those things.","Sorry, you're right. She did not like anyway. She said it woke her up. Does she said ""But um"" so often?"
"She thinks she is strong. That's right, I have to prove that I am not the weak. I will make her jealous.","Easy, that's the plan: A, layer with Jenkins. Two, I sleep with Jenkins first. Three, the second rule is the first I'm going to rule 2."
"She throws herself on her and continues to type.","Marshall, you're in the field!"
"Hi friends, any sport has had its icon, which it excels. Ali was boxing, basketball had Jordan, and the sport of sleeping with b*mb snuff chance, my next guest, Mr Barney Stinson.Barney, welcome.","Thank you, Jim. I'm glad to be back on the show."
"It's good to have you. And you know, the statistics, they really speak for themselves. Over 200 women spread over 6 continents, 17 countries, 74 sexual positions, and not a single bead. Impressive. But even with all these successes, there has always been an escape for you. Which brings us back to last week. Tell us about our history.","Hold on, Jimbo, it is extraordinary."
"First night... Barney, Ted, Lily and Marshall are at McLaren's.","It all started when I decided to start a small challenge."
"He decides his victim.","Whatever the girl I'm trying to point is that I go with her tonight. And... they're off!"
"So, the first night was pretty normal.","Jim, there is nothing in my usual way to pack."
"Second night...","That brings us to the second night. You see the b*mb that pampers its Black Russian? She left to exchange it with a White American. Enter me five! You know... If you're not careful, you'll lose me."
"It's all I want to be.","I guess that's just what they said when I was gone."
"I believe it. You are awesome. Now, night 3. Describe it to us.","Jim, I can tell you that I was gone, so I wanted a little spice."
"Third night...","I think I'll take small tits tonight."
"You're yucky.","Lily, it's people too."
"Wear what bad luck?","I had left to do... flawless."
"Awesome. I mean, it's the equivalent of sexual perfect game in baseball, in even harder.","Yeah. The only player in history to have accomplished both Pete was Drexell 'The mustache' in 1896."
"It was not the first time you were about to accomplish. So you knew that one mistake, and we reach the end. Sometimes a teammate makes a mistake. Sometimes a minefield...","You and me in the closet of the Spanish supermarket next door."
".. takes you straight into the wall. And sometimes you spread yourself. And it almost always ends badly. But this week, you were to 3 of 3, and no sign of abating.","I can even say, without a fault. I'd love to say the same of my friends."
"So you're at four, he'll just make a 5 to 7.","Well done, Jim."
"I'm going. He needs a brother. Hey buddy.","Hey!"
"Is everything okay?","Absolutely. A background. It could not get better. I make fun of that? I need you."
"Anything you want. What's the matter?","Which of these girls look the most stupid?"
"Let's see it. Already heated to perfection? The smashed out? Ok I will deal for Big Mac.","Thank you, Skip."
"Barney, I will interrupt you one second, I must ask you something. Have you ever taken Viagra?","No, sir. I like to play by the rules. While I can not say I did not propose to."
"It was pretty awesome. You should try it. I still have a few.","No thank you."
"You sure? Ok, do as you like. What time is it?","It's 8:00."
"Hey, what are you doing here? Returns to the bar!","Ted, relax. I am already 6 of 6."
"Great. What really happened?","I ate at the ""Staten Island Chili's,"" and I jumped a hairdresser completely stuffed. Are you happy, Ulysses?"
"Barney, we know that you are going you may get fired. Wait, you ought to speak. You turn away from reality, kissing unnecessarily on all sides.","No vain, ok? Between number 5 and I, there was a connection. She will resume her studies, she has a child or who is studying... something with ""studies""."
"Unbelievable. You know, there are two things that do not.First: you do not open an email from Phil Simms to your children.And second: you do not wear bad luck to a man on track to flawless.","I do not know what to tell you, Lily is always trying to ruin me any."
"I think she cracked a bit for the Barnacle.","You have the eye to notice such details, Jim Nantz."
"Do not tell me that she dared to say ""The door-jinx, it does not exist.""","I wish I had power."
"You were about to achieve something so beautiful.","Well, thank you to her, the only thing that can prevent a stroke insured was about to walk out the door. A member of the New York Yankees World Champions in 2009."
"It's happening, look.","You wanna come to my house and watch the collection of snowballs?"
"It was well played, well played, well played.","But not play well enough. All this week was a waste of time. And tomorrow I'm getting fired."
"We frightened a couple great just because we share a toothbrush.","You share a toothbrush?"
"Well, they and Ted.",".. Huh?"
"I'm sorry. Lily, Nick Swisher think it's cute.","Martini?"
"What do you say we go home?","Wow, to be honest, this is not my habit, but I feel a real connection, Number 7... Christy. I beg you. I did it! I did it!"
"Unbelievable. Congratulations on your faultless.","Thank you, Jim. I would never have done it without the help of my friends."
"Hey, on another subject, you really think you could get fired today?","Uh, Jim, I told you I wanted to talk about it."
"Barney, I go straight from your imagination, so apparently we must talk! Think about it.","What a c**t."
"Stinson, we made a decision. We keep you. I know this last week has been hard.","I barely slept."
"Dibs on his wings!","Hey, guys!"
"Hey!","Does anyone know who won the Superbowl?"
"You were there. It was the...","I won! Because I'm now in possession of a magic phone that always rings. And you know who's always usually on the other end? A chick. So how many chicks do I have calling me now? Infinity! Guys, remember Ranjit?"
"Good to see you.","OK I've enlisted Ranjit's services as my personal driver because for the next week I'll be sleeping with hundreds of women and I don't want to take the subway cause... you know... germs!"
"Wait, you're... you're actually gonna hook up with these girls that call you?","Oh, indubitably! I'm meeting the first one here any minute. Keep your eyes pealed for a red sweater. Based on her texts, she's dirty, dyslexic and want to 96 me, semi-colon and parenthesis."
"I did NOT...say... it was a good plan.","Guys, guys, guys, we're on me now. And it is getting in-teh-resting. Looks at these texts. Read this one. Yowza! Now look at this one. Does she text her mother with those fingers? Now look at this one... or this one, or this one, or this one, or..."
"OK OK OK buddy, how about you do this? Go nail that girl, then read your texts.","I can't do that, Ted. I just can't hook up with a girl if there is a hotter girl out there with whom up can be hooked."
"Yes, kids, sometimes there's a fine line between love and hate. Case and point.","McLaren's pub."
"McLaren's pub.","Well, heeelllooo."
"Well, heeelllooo.","McLaren's pub."
"I realize that you're very busy, so I'll just get straight to the point.","OK."
"Barney had been sure that phone was something he loved. But now he realized it wasn't that at all. It was something else entirely.","I'm free."
"What's wrong?","Did you hear that?"
"Hear what?","McLaren's pub!!"
"Why would Ted order the rabbit if he's just gonna run out?","I need it back. Where is the phone? Well, heeellooooo. Oh I met you already. Where is the phone?"
"It's hidden.","Where?"
"Rabbit. Sorry, guys, I gotta go.","My phone. I'm taking it back. And I'm taking your cool nickname too. Barney Westside speaking."
"Friends, tonight is the night. I invite Tiffany home to see my collection of vintage cameras.","It's the lure of Ted."
"Bait?","A true gentleman invents an excuse to bring home a respectable lady. Something interesting or beautiful that can claim to admire for 5 minutes before it starts on the track."
"It was the first week of college. I was way into Wu-Tang Clan.","It's tricky. It must be interesting enough that the girl up, but not too much not to spoil the evening."
"Barney is a girl with him and they play a slot machine.","The slot machine is too much fun. And a trampoline... that's actually too dangerous. But I finally found the perfect bait... A mini pig."
"I can borrow your mini pig?","Yes, you can borrow."
"What? I am not to his hook.","Yes, completely."
"""For now"" you draw a picture of a future where everything will be magical, but in truth, it'll never happen.","It's like that. ""I can not be with you"". ""For now."""
"Barney is Ted at the bar.","Really? You really gonna sit and watch the door all night because Tiffany said she would try to pass?"
"No, moron!","Ted, let me be clear. That girl is poison and you have to forget your life forever."
"There she is. It has led to colleagues.","Hold on to it. Never lets go! I have never seen more beautiful girls. They all work with Tiffany?"
"Yep.","There can be only one explanation for that. Tiffany is a representative... e, pharmaceuticals?"
"What? It's just a job.","That a b... Since time immemorial there has always been a professional edge to which girls g*n, like Tiffany, have flocked. I'll redo the story?"
"I will not say explicitly.","It began 2.5 million years ago. The man was a hunter.So the profession's sexiest moment? Picker. h*m* erectus, indeed. With improved technology, the profession's sexiest moment was changing. I'm sure it's a hernia. You can double-check? And then the man grabbed the heavens. So girls sexy stiletto heels began and became a flight attendant. I'm right and ready to fire. Then the man said, ""Life is hard. I should start taking lots of drugs. "" So sexy girls landed in medical offices, hot enough to make these pills erection ironically unnecessary. So today, girls are pharma's sexiest moment."
"She touched my nose.","Largue Tiffany and join the Barnacle in a buffet of girls pharma. There may be loss of clothing, knees b*rned, respiratory weakness and sore abs the next day. That the world give a damn five?!"
"Ted returns to McLaren's, where Barney is still there.","There's no nights like with pharma pharma because the nights never stop! Dude, I've flirted with three of them. The fantasy. In addition, my cholesterol is low. My restless legs syndrome is cured. I am more alive than ever."
"Robin and Barney are at McLaren's.","Yesterday I was with this girl so sexy that pharma should call a doctor if you have no erection for more than 4h. I have no reason people?"
"Let's go have a drink.","It's over."
"You're a little dramatic.","Really? It starts with a Gladys. And suddenly, a few gay guys not so fabulous fall into the ranks. And before you know it, the girls look like pharma team to a Southwest flight to Albuquerque in Little Rock. It's over!"
"You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?","I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits."
"Why change your mind?","The realization that hope springs eternal. Ca and the little purple pill box found in my bag. I do not know what they are, but they are amazing!"
"Okay, big guy, tell me all along.","It all started a week ago."
"Barney is at McLaren's.","I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady."
"Nothing is sexier than a man wearing a nice tie.","Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie."
"Right.","So, right after that, I took her home."
"When I'm in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger to satisfy every single... the carnal desires of my lover.","Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow."
"Good night.","What? Wait, what? I thought your body would become a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger only to satisfy my every carnal desires."
"Ted, Marshall and Lily's apartment and listen to Barney.","I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners."
"I'm in the inter-gender-ing, and I have some sex-seconds before the light turns green. And then, everyone honks, and it really sex, but I can not run because a jogger slips and falls in the Sacraments of sex-horse.","Continuous. Continues."
"It's the cashmere?","Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns."
"12 microns. I like the tight fibers.","Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle."
"Barney at the bar with a woman.","You try this shit of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail."
"It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass.","Did you just say you got a kid!"
"You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date.","Completely."
"Or the second. Or the third.","Of course. Well..."
"Or the fourth.","Just tell me how!"
"17.","Excuse me, someone is using this stool?"
"If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up.","I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted..."
"From Robin is Robin.","I can have two shots ahead. There is a flaw in there and I will get it."
"You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you.","I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan: I'll sleep with her."
"The band is at the bar.","This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger. I put on the StairMaster and..."
"It does.","Spoilers. Regardless, we did."
"Ted and Barney are at McLaren's.","Shit. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do?"
"There is another option... but you're not ready.","Tell me."
"If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.","A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?"
"If you want my help, it's a super hot date.","Okay."
"Let me do it. I will plan everything.","You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?"
"Cutesy and romantic? No need to take him to Paris or Peru...","What are you doing?"
"You just gotta make him understand...","They look at us."
"How important it is for you...","Really? You really gonna do that?"
"In your super hot date, Global problems will simply be put aside, for wonders and surprises that will be the stars. Hurry, do not be late because together, you will find a country where paradise is rebukes. And then, boom! Fireworks in the sky over Manhattan! You kiss him. And your super hot date.","It looks to me like cutesy and romantic. Box strip?"
"Barney and whistles will open the door of his apartment.Marshall followed between Ted and Lily, and he will give a punch in the robot's head of Barney.","Why did you do that?"
"Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire.","Why are you angry against me?"
"You were a real assh*le to Robin when she was in her period of mourning.","The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning."
"Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you.","What, she is upset?"
"I'm going.","We go back home..."
"Barney throws his hat into the robot.","I can not believe that Robin is upset."
"And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.","I did worse after the premiere of ""The Phantom Menace.""It's been like that since we broke up?"
"Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where.","I know where."
"Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date.","I know you're upset."
"She pulls without the headphones on, then ends up throwing his g*n because there is more balls.","You sure you're not upset?"
"Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?","You're not another number for me."
"And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks.","I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?"
"Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you.","Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want."
"Do not sleep with Anita.","I promise."
"Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?","It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go."
"Anita Barney comes to see who is at the bar with Ted, Marshall and Lily.","I wanted to call you."
"I violate any rules in my coming here, but... no one asks me rabbit like that, so we go out or not?","I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no."
"I see. You try the trick of ""no."" You really think it'll work?Because it will not work. Okay, I'll make a deal. Maybe... you might get lucky after the 12th hot date.","No."
"The 11th?","No."
"The fifth?","No."
"Tonight?","No."
"This evening before dinner?","No."
"Go.","I'm sorry. The answer is no."
"She slides in the hollow of the ear. He gets up and leaves. He descends the stairs and jump over a fence and landed in the water.","Here is my story."
"A fireworks bursting in the sky while Barney is on the bench wrapped in a blanket.","I hope so too."
"I want the perfect group sh*t. Marshall put yourself between Robin and Barney.","Why?"
"Of course. You will not last! The photo is forever.","How dare you?"
"It's so rude.","It's true."
"I would say Amanda.","No, it was me. And I meant it."
"Or we could continue the descent on the Avenue Best Birthday.","I Can Vote? Street bitch! Street bitch!"
"Almost. This is Leilani. She had to come at Christmas because, you said, ""Folks, this may be good."" And this is not the only ""maybe good"". Eve 2007, Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall and ""It's good"" Emily. The funeral of Uncle Cecil Robin, Marshall, Lily, Robin, Barney, Ted and... ""It proves that you selected the eyes closed"" Isabelle. My appendicitis, Robin, Marshall, Barney, Lily, Ted, and it... you've admitted, you just wanted to make. Compliance.","You remember the yoga teacher that got you into my birthday?"
"The band is at McLaren's.","Thank you. You believe not just enter. Look! Look! Why not look at you! This is Slash from g*n N'Roses!"
"It was there, we know the end.","False!"
"Oh? So do I.","And me too. He has how many hands?"
"Wait. Look at these pictures. Barney always has the same pose and all these years.","Yes, at this point, I have never an old head on the photos. Neither ever or always."
"It's gotta be a lousy picture of you.","Nope, not at all."
"And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly.","Not the Barnacle. I always look awesome mortally. Not like Marshall, who seems to be ingeniously death."
"They are not all bad. Like... this. Look. I have my eyes open.","You really put a knot!"
"A crisp, Barney?","Of course."
"I! A photo ugly.","You sure?"
"No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?","It's physically impossible for me to take a picture ugly. I know why. Ask God."
"It's terrible. My laptop is just... fell. You me collected?(Barney looks to pick it up) Mouse, f*ck! I!","You sure?"
"Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!","The camera loves me. Much more than that. The device I want. The unit wants to put on underwear, put an Al Green CD, dim the lights and do all the work while I was still lying with closed eyes."
"Sorry that my search for love has you so upset. You know, your precious photos might be better if I was not over.","They would be if Marshall was not on it."
"I think Lori's age made him very wise.","It is said that it was after 40 years we know each other really."
"It's a hole in your jacket?","What? Where?"
"Come on, everybody. Come here. Let's make a memory.","Is there anything in the sauce that you've made? It tastes like... coriander. And... you know that cilantro makes me..."
"No one played as well as Barney with this limit. A breeze for him.","I love traveling."
"Really? What is the best place that you hast visited?","Hawaii is fun. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. It's really not bad. But the best place? I must say, the moon."
"You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.","Ted, a blonde, it's easy."
"But I worked at a yogurt shop in high school. And indeed, it was... insane.","So, after 20 minutes, the eagle has landed. We fuse into space. Houston, we have a complainer. Other double entender related to space."
"Why are you lying all the time?","I do not lie! We made love, I have pictures!"
"Our coupons are your effigy.","I'm not saying he loves pizza, but the last time he went, the doctor said, ""stop eating pizza. ""Marshall:"" Why? ""Doc:"" To you examine. "" But seriously, we laugh because we love you."
"Did you get mugged?","Who? He wore a black hat and beard of the day? He said ""Hands up! ""?"
"It was downright terrifying.","It was downright terrifying."
"Okay, you know what? We'll all calm down. We do not need a g*n. I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life.","I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. It's great. But I think I'll add a tear."
"Listen baby, I know it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine.You can put this behind us?","It's gold! But I'd rather say 'put me behind you. """
"I know. I know. Listen, I must confess something. This attack did not go exactly as I said.","So it was indeed a black bonnet. J'l'avais said!"
"He as*ault you naked?","I do not ask where he kept his w*apon."
"Ted, Barney and Lily laugh at Marshall.","You've been mugged by a monkey?"
"This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us.","Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?"
"Hi, friends. What's new?","New information has been discovered on the attack on Marshall."
"Okay. That's what happened.","No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana..."
"I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well.","You're right. The banana was on the floor."
"Was not... Was not banana banana.","Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened."
"Barney entered the apartment while Ted is sitting on the couch.","I've just been mugged."
"Neil? Neil!","Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar..."
"You've just mugged?","Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?"
"You're the lemon in your hair.","The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts..."
"Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a g*n.","You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?"
"I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a w*apon. In truth, it never happened.","I can not believe."
"I would not?","If serious, this is too funny."
"Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends.","I, yes, but still."
"But I can not lie on national TV.","You know a long time. He told the truth?"
"I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.","I still say that it happened."
"Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.","Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body."
"It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.","False! They like to discover that they lied. ""Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth."" Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!"
"You mean what you done to him.","No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said."
"Yes, Neil?","It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied."
"This is the belt of Planar 3?","You know it."
"You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey.","Yeah! I knew it."
"Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.","Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that?"
"It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.","Dude, what do you do?"
"I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.","Now I want a w*apon."
"No! I have not been mugged!","You know if it was attacked?"
"Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.","It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good."
"Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.","Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way."
"It's really happening?","Of course, Ted."
".. never...",".. seen."
"And Mahatma Gandhi. And pancakes. Well all together! And the dragon. And you.","Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done."
"20 seconds ago...","You're currently whining?"
"I know it's stupid, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?","Not as much as me, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done."
"You marry when?","Robin whining during the song Clint. Oh, I've already said. The super good sister of Ted, Heather!"
"I know. His mother called such five times to ask where he was.","Sorry Robin. They are all out of pretzels. And I know how you're emotional. Shh. Leave it alone."
"Okay! Okay, I... I cried during the song Clint.","She cried to the song of Clint."
"I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork.","And that was fine with Blair Witch, and she tried to haggle on closing costs?"
"I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move.","Is it in the room with us right now, Ted?"
"Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done.","The dumbest thing that ON've ever done."
"My God, you had to be completely stuffed.","No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened."
"Children? Why...","Put rockets in..."
"Bourre.","Gamin."
"Drum roll, please. I was... Drunk!","You know, I'm glad Robin have guessed. Because it is really sensitive and fragile. I talk about the times she cried during the song Clint. And while I whisper, I hope she hears me."
"Are you crying?","I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?"
"Not as much as me.","I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me."
"$ 500? No worries.","Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done."
"Oh, hey! The doorbell does not work.","Wait, wait. You will inspect the place where now?"
"But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.","It was Robin! ""What! ""Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know."
"Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?","Of course."
"You're always a little too far.","Shit."
"The ceiling collapsed.","I see a complaint."
"You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?","Thank you. My God."
"Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.","OK, buddy. Sometimes people make bad decisions in life. Like your mother."
"Please, stop.","Actually, Virginia and I spent a special time in 2006.Before Clint."
"In 2006... Barney is in a car with Ted's mother.","And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go."
"Here we go.","It is a good time. Not much traffic..."
"Oh, I love this song.","Is it true? Hmm. I can... Listen... Ted's mother. I... I should really..."
"Again?! One too many!","Okay, that's good. Well, I invented the last, but everything else, I swear it was true. Come on, man. Your mother is a cougar."
"Wait, I thought you said that a cougar could not be more than 50 years.","Okay, this is a Mellencamp."
"It's silly.","Your mother and I were at second base."
"I thought about it.","You think about it? You hardly know him. In addition, the guy is a draw with a job that is worthless."
"We have the same job, Barney.","And we could not be more proud of you, my angel."
"Why not let the solid brick to remind us not to buy?","All right. As a former... before you embark on anything, I'm meeting this guy. I think it's pretty weird not having yet met."
"Bluntly. It's as if someone was orchestrating things for this specific purpose. Okay, but you must promise to behave well.","I promise."
"Robin presented to Don Barney.","I'm doing this contortionist Portuguese, and I swear... it is so flexible, at a time, it was about me and beneath me. A top and a bottom! One and two! Which is empty?"
"Robin had never told Don she was out with Barney.","I appreciate you, Don. Both, we love a good scotch, one likes my stories compelling. And we went out with Robin."
"The'm not, it's as if we had never been together.","In short, the arms of the Erasmus student have dropped and there fell of my swing. Seriously, I have not found a girl who can do that from Robin."
"I came to apologize to you. I exaggerated.","Well, there you should also apologize. We said some pretty hurtful."
"It's great.","I can not wait, buddy."
"Don and Robin out of the bar.","I have to get Robin."
"Are you kidding?","I do not know what it is, but I want to get Robin."
"I know what it is. You're like... a kid who threw his toys and wants them back as soon as another plays with.","I had perhaps not done playing with. I just left to play with something else for a while."
"You ready.","Ready for what?"
"When Barney and Robin have broken in the fall before...","Hanging out with Robin was a huge mistake."
"Write it.","What?"
"Write yourself a letter. That way you will remember the reasons for the break when you miss.","My pleasure. Dear Barney... the future... This ink is too cool."
"Right?","You... and Robin..."
"Get it?","I understand. I really want it back."
"Don made sushi, it's cool, huh? He learned in Japan.","It's too easy."
"Be nice. You want it just because you can not have it. Like saying ""Sit wherever you want, except on that chair."" You will be so...","My chair!"
"I do too. It is more spicy, the better.","Me too, man. More than you, certainly. Instance. Super spicy. I feel bad."
"It yes, with his personal trainer.","This pepper is an ice cube in my mouth."
"Don and Robin and Barney kiss between them.","Don Tokyo... You ever do that... in Japan? Wasabi!"
"Well, I hope you're happy.","I stay on my position. It was bold and romantic."
"You were emptied from the top and bottom.","Come on. Did you do stupid stuff to impress Robin."
"Yes, but not anymore, because I turned the page. Just like you.","You have not turned the page. You want it as much as me, but you not admit it."
"He fetches a box.","For my biographer?"
"I stole a blue french horn for her... I was with her for a year.I wanted her to be the mother of my children and spend eternity in his arms.",".. I want to sleep with her, at least one last time. She is mine!"
"It's not for you! And it's not mine, either. It is... to Don.","Okay. We must get rid of him. You know, metaphorically."
"Of course.","Or... literally. That's how it starts! I'm afraid, Teddy!"
"Ted and Barney are always quarreling about who will be Robin.","Robin Stinson!"
"Robin Mosby!","Robin Stinson!"
"Ted Scherbatsky. I would take his name. I do not care.","Okay, wait. What do you say to that? It is being shared?I take up to 40 years and after you can have it."
"Who we laugh? It is with Don. We must accept it and move on.","You're right. I go to you... I go to the bathroom. And then I'll break..."
"Robin's phone rings, she picks.","It's BarnExclussif."
"No. Ted, not quit. I'll remember. Ted is on the other line... and I think he has a problem.","Ted calls you? Indeed, he has a problem."
"We almost lose control.","It's true. I'm going to leave before something regrettable."
"Barney crying in the street.","Robin, I love you!"
"Species of bastard! I brought the blue French horn!","I brought the blue French horn! Ted has just given me.Sorry, I was there before you."
"Come on, get.","All right! Here we go! You, Me and Ted!"
"You abandoned easily. Game, set and match!","We won the fingers in the nose..."
"You're welcome. Good night, guys.","Good night, Dad."
"The Teddy Bear, BarnExclussif.","Dad?"
"We get up, f*ck. You remember last night?","Damn, Ted was torn. Embarrassing..."
"Ted joins Barney in MacLaren's.","So what's going on with Robin?"
"You were right, she was just angry. It's been four days and not talk to relocate. We must never repeat this kind of shit.","I agree. In fact... I even wrote another letter. Dear Barney the future, you think you want to get Robin, thou wilt not true. Let her. Sincerely, Barney's past."
"Let me see!","Give me that."
"Ps... The top was for Ted. He believed? Fine. Pull yourself together with Robin, but say nothing to Ted because he will still go wrong. And there are still drawings of breasts.","In my defense, the breasts, is not it great?"
"Ted joins Barney, Marshall and Lily at McLaren's.","Guess what I have behind my back."
"Wait, wait. I will find. Left.","Not a good game but okay. Five tickets well placed to Robots vs. Wrestlers."
"Great!","You know Robots vs. Wrestlers?"
"But we think some kind of sport in which robots wrestlers.","That's exactly it, according to the website!"
"Wait, wait. Who is the fifth ticket?","Uh... Robin. I know... She lives with her boyfriend and she said not wanting to hang out with us, but it's Robots vs. Wrestlers. Robots vs.... Wrestlers!"
"Marshall, Lily, Ted and Barney are at the bar.","She said no? How could she? Robots vs. Wrestlers of our tradition is the largest group."
"Tradition? It was never done.","It's Robots vs. Wrestlers, Lily. This is obviously a tradition. It starts like this. First, Robin moves in with Don and Marshall and Lily have a baby, then Ted..."
"Goes?","I was going to say ""was found eaten by her cats,"" but it's not good either. Everybody leaves me, and I like it!"
"Relax... It's for Marissa Heller.","Marissa Heller? She looks good. Face, breasts, describe. Begins with the breasts."
"It's about an open bar.","We change the plan for Saturday. Evening Marissa Heller for alcohol and Robots vs. Wrestlers. But one of us should pretend to Marissa Heller."
"I just got a text from Robin. It says...","Guys, we get together. Lil, you can do... All you have to watch the guy in front, say your name is Marissa Heller, and it passes. And I repeat, to be sure, no accent."
"What do we do?","I do we go to the party, that's what! We met at the meeting of ornithophilic."
"I do not believe.","Lovers of wicker?"
"So, this way. We are together.","I said I'd get us."
"I'm not dressed for it.","In a coined word ""asshole-Apocalypse."""
"Barney talks to a woman.","This morning I made the heart of the Ambassador of the Netherlands. I hope he gets better."
"Films... right? Actors. Willem Dafoe. Fun Fact of Willem Dafoe, his name sounds a bit like a frog, a parrot that talks. Willem Dafoe...! Willem Dafoe...!","As Undersecretary of Finance, I had a great influence on this legislation. Now, I wonder if you will accompany me in the map room to stimulate my package."
"I do not think, my dear. You're too old for me.","Zsa Zsa Gabor is still sexy, but other than that, it is rotten this holiday."
"Look, I'm having fun here, so I'll pass Robots vs. Wrestlers.","But you never missed Robots vs. Wrestlers. It happens that way. First Robin us loose, and now you? And for those pretentious snobs and old game?"
"Actually, I like those pretentious snobs and they are not old fashioned fart noise when I open my mouth. I remain. See you tomorrow.","It's an evening."
"It means nothing.","It means everything. If you come not to Robots vs. Wrestlers, it's the end of our friendship."
"See you tomorrow.","All right. So you do most of our group, forever. You can ask to return in 2 years. Come see wrestlers fight like robots. I'm embarrassed. I forgot something."
"The best tradition of all time!","You crazy not me, Marshall. Let's be honest. The group is finite. Ted is gone, like Robin. That separates us as well."
"Boy, Barney, stop with your abandonment issues. Ted has the right to have a life outside the group. As we all.","Wait. Why do you say that all of a sudden? My God, you're pregnant!"
"That's all you got, f*g?","You can at least promise to not get pregnant within a year?"
"I can not.","You can not?"
"Okay, again! Bravo, my boy!","No! You can not have children! You want to raise a child in this crazy world."
"The world is pretty cool right now.","Okay, Lily, I have no choice. If you have a daughter, day, no, the minute she is 18... Gong!"
"Babies.","I hope Ted is unhappy."
"Thank you, Will Shortz.","Okay, you can have a baby, but only under the following conditions: 1-You promise to always love me more than the baby, 2-Once a month, I can use to shake the baby, 3 - It may include a drop baby from the first floor and that saves me; 4-No breastfeeding in front of me. Forget the five-four, get out your breasts when you want."
"Barney, Marshall and Lily are at the bar.","Rule number 83. If something out of the baby ends up on my costume, I can touch the breasts of Lily."
"Dude, what's your thing with the breasts of my woman tonight?","It is not I who make the rules."
"Ted arrives at the bar.","Look who thinks he can come here and repeat the group. Well, you can forget. Pity, remake the group! I want to lose anyone yet! We're sorry. You can recite all the poems of assh*le that you want, we never say anything bad on it, I promise."
"Ted enters a room where Barney.","What do you think of this tie?"
"Thank you, God. Barney Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a dead prostitute in the closet, right?","This one is better?"
"The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage.","I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie? Ted, I can tell you a big secret?"
"Yeah, sure.","I do not really talk about the tie."
"Yeah, I realized that Barney.","I wonder if this will be a disaster. And if it was the worst of all marriage?"
"Impossible. It has already been the worst of all marriage.","That of Punchy."
"Hi. Guys before you go that you bother to read my toast for the wedding?","Yeah, no problem, of course."
"Ted pulls out a thick binder.","Woow."
"Oh, not that much. Now I am a total disaster for all my old high school friends. And a lot of people in Finland are the big stuff. This is why I have to type this toast.","Ted, you can hit you something else to this marriage.Let the big binder. The only thing you have to bring it to Cleveland."
"This fall I became the youngest designer in the history of New York by building a skyscraper. This earned me a brilliant article in a magazine. I plan to frame it. Uncle Barney had different plans.","Here's your speech. ""In single file, girls. No big. """
"This is ridiculous.","Yeah, you're right. This is Cleveland. ""In single file, girls. """
"Children, you remember Nora. But the other day...","I'll call you."
"Or you called? It's not that I want to know. So what? I do not care. You did?","I did not call."
"Me. Or maybe we should make the hot sauce on Barney, now that's a sissy.","I'm not a wimp. Nora wanted a professional. Not me.That's it. And yes, Robin, I want chicken wings."
"So we all went to my hometown where we had planned to celebrate the marriage of Punchy. Uncle Barney had other plans.","Stand ready, Cleveland. The last guy who has conned you so hard and then disappeared was LeBron James."
"You're going to try to make you anybody here?","What?"
"My God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between the annoying friend of Ted and that is what this-face. A little respect.","It's not just be someone. This is a market survey. You see, my legendary success rate of 83%..."
"17. He always reverse.",".. never happens by accident. Each technique used to drag a woman has been thoroughly field tested. By eliminating improper techniques in small markets like Cleveland. I know which will go to New York. For example, tonight marks the inauguration of the escaped prisoner. Do prisoners on the run are sexy?"
"No, no.","We'll never know unless I try tonight."
"During the season of super bowl, but if they mean the super bowl. Go Vikings.","Prisoners on the run are not sexy. At the same time it was a faulty concept. Next step, the patient zero."
"You're more drunk than I thought. I mean, look at this type.","Wait, wait, wait, before you leave, please do respond to this survey to help me better to seduce you in the future.What does not work for you in this game of seduction? Does A do not you think that I hold a bailiff of the world? B or fingernails disgusts you? Sea..."
"Yes, everyone encourages you. Plus some new friends from Finland. Hey, good luck, Schmos.","Take that. Shows them how much you're great. Say your ad, not ashamed, say that."
"Really? That's why he tries to Lebron anything that moves?","It does not work for you because A vampires are offside, B or pretend that I invented Facebook was a bit too?"
"Well. Barney, just to make things clear...","I know what you gonna say. Show in Cleveland, how it goes."
"Barney's phone rings.","Sorry. Oh, my God, this is Nora. She finally ended up reminding me."
"Wait, you said you'd never recalled.","I lied. I called, like, five times. Wait, wait! You guys you know better than anyone how I show this stuff. Will you help me please? I would like just once to see what it feels like when you do not quite fair."
"To tell you how I feel.","To tell you how I feel."
"I know it did not work the first time...","I know it did not work the first time..."
".. and it makes no sense...",".. and it makes no sense..."
".. but I can not help thinking that goes well together.",".. but I can not help thinking that goes well together."
"Is there a part of you that wants to try again?","Is there a part of you that wants to try again?"
"No marriage will be as bad as that one, huh?","I chose the right tie, huh?"
"This is a good story. I will return. We are not even close to the end.","You're a good best man, Ted. You'll cry during the toast, right?"
"A knock on the door.","Between."
"What happened to your leg?","Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some ""sympathy points"". She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of ""Man of La Mancha."" What do you think?"
"Lose the cast.","A one-man show... I love it!"
"Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?","You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it."
"The next night, Barney and Nora saw each other for a coffee.Fortunately, without the neck brace ridiculous.","Hi Nora, thank you for coming."
"What happened to your neck?","My naked...? Oh, that's nothing. I was playing in a One Man Show at Fiddler. There was this scene..."
"Breasts...","Wait, Nora, waiting... No, please. I'm sorry."
"What is wrong with you? What kind of people need to lie like that?","Someone who likes you, really. And suspicious, and probably accurately you do it over more later, and therefore he feels the need... I'm sorry, you spoke of this fantastic pair of tits, right? Because I seek, and I do not see them."
"Let me clarify something for you. I do not date guys who lie to me.","Okay, I did not know. Mea culpa. So, from now, more lies. I never lie to you. I'm serious. Ask me anything."
"OK Have you ever managed to get in bed with a woman that you lied?","Have I ever... If I'm totally honest... Yes."
"More than once?","More than once... Wow, this is... I guess if we... so, technically, there were a number of times I've lied to a woman to sleep with her."
"They were worth what?","Nine or ten for most. There has been a 4 once. It was an easy girl.But, Nora, after that, I had to flee so fast. Honesty is good."
"What was the lie?","You want me to tell all the lies I have told to put a woman in my bed?"
"A bed or any other place where you're sent into the air.","You are good."
"Meanwhile, Barney continued to list every lie he used to sleep.","I do not have time to explain how I got there. I just need someone to suck the poison. The surgeon gave me a new face, darling. You realize that I am alive? My name is David Beckham. If I castais only the white swan, is the role for you. No, I am a lesbian. What I wear is just very realistic."
"Ok, let's move. What was the worst? The best of the worst? The cream of the crop?","Oh, once I am the soul man. There was this pretty girl who only go out with black."
"I was going to the darts, but it's Edward bottles to money!","And that made all the lies related to space. Let the world of sports. Oh wait, I forgot for a space: ""I was bitten by a snake space. You have to suck all the poison around my... """
"Okay, Barney, I have things to work tomorrow at 8 am which means I have just enough time to spend 11h in my shower to wash away all that.","So that was cool. I can remember, or...?"
"Barney, you're funny, beautiful, and really nice. But you are also a sociopath.","Well, I count three for and one against."
"How can you still believe you have a chance with me?","Because you are sat here all night. You could leave, but you did not. Listen, Nora, these lies, it was the old me. But I swear I try to change.You... make me want to change."
"How I know this is not a lie?","I will prove it. I'll show you how much I'm serious. I will not leave this restaurant as I have not got a second date with you."
"Goodbye Barney.","I do not laugh. It is a restaurant 24h/24. I will stay forever if necessary. And I will. Just water for me please."
"Barney rises behind Marshall and Lily.","Oh! Hi guys! Oh! My neck! Uh... oh! Hey! Look at this!"
"Barney, what are you doing here?","Oh, I told Nora that I would not leave until I have no second appointment, and I intend to do. I am here since 9 o'clock. I still need another minute. Say I'm crazy, but I'll stay here as long as it will not be returned."
