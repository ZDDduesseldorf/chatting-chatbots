Ted joined the band at McLaren's.
Ted: Friends, tonight is the night. I invite Tiffany home to see my collection of vintage cameras.
Barney: It's the lure of Ted.
Lily: Bait?
Barney: A true gentleman invents an excuse to bring home a respectable lady. Something interesting or beautiful that can claim to admire for 5 minutes before it starts on the track.
Ted: As if she had to "borrow a book" or "listen to old vinyl."
Marshall: Or see your new poster rap.
Robin: Post rap? On which it would work?
Lily: It was the first week of college. I was way into Wu-Tang Clan.
Barney: It's tricky. It must be interesting enough that the girl up, but not too much not to spoil the evening.

Tiffany: You have a mini pig? I can not believe it! You're too cute!You're the cutest little pig on Earth! What?
Ted: You've always been so beautiful? You're going out on "In high school I was super shy and I in my skin"?
Tiffany: I was shy and ill at ease. I'd like 50 more pounds and protruding teeth.
Ted: Seriously?
Tiffany: No. I was always canon. What can I do? You know who else would love this mini pig?  My boyfriend.
GENERIC
Ted: You got a boyfriend?
Tiffany: I know... Boring, eh? Finally, it is... not really my boyfriend.
Ted: Okay.
Tiffany: Well, technically it is.
Ted: He is or not?
Tiffany: A little each but not both.
Ted: Do you understand anything?
Tiffany: I appreciate you. But you must be patient. I do not want to lose you, my Dark Brown.
Ted: Someone does not want to lose his Dark Brown.
Robin: She gave you her hook.
Ted: What? I am not to his hook.
Barney: Yes, completely.
Robin: It gives you false hope, but it does not engage with you, but it keeps you in the corner, just in case, like... an old canned chili in the pantry.
Lily: Who would buy a can of chili for not eating it away?
Marshall: Amen, sister.
Robin: Do you feel pretty good. It is gone. It was on both sides. I was hooked and crocheter. It's good guys. I was shameless, but I did not have money problems.
Marshall: I've been hooked. Lisa Walker. See the scene... In 1994, St. Cloud, Minnesota.
Flashback
Marshall is sitting outside his house with a girl.
Marshall: So I was, like, thinking, Lisa, do, perhaps you want, like, go out with me?

Marshall: I understand.
Lisa: What if we did that? You could be my secret boyfriend who does all my homework.
Marshall: Okay. Wanna see my post of rap?

End flashback
Marshall: It was fine in the end. It freed me from its hook.
Ted: That's not the same with me and Tiffany. Listen.
Flashback
Tiffany: You interest me very much. But I can not be with you for now.
End flashback
Robin: "Right now" is the catch phrase of choice.
Marshall: "For now" you draw a picture of a future where everything will be magical, but in truth, it'll never happen.
Barney: It's like that. "I can not be with you". "For now."
Lily: I think my high school boyfriend Scooter, is a little to my hook.
Marshall: A little? Completely. The poor showed up at our wedding hope you recover.

Lily: It explains a lot.
Flashback
Lily: Scooter canteen was still there today.
Marshall: You're mounted on it? You did a tour?
Lily: No!
Marshall: Really? In your place I would have rode this scooter all day to break it into two.
End flashback
Marshall: So these poor women must still walk? Expect. Scooter works in your school?
Lily: Are you jealous?
Marshall: I feel bad for Scooter. It took this job just because he thinks he has a chance with you. You must ensure that he understands that it is wrong for it turns the page and gets a real work canteen. Shit!
Lily: I tried!
Flashback

End flashback
Marshall: "For now"? You got to the earnest Scooter? You must release your scooter hook.
Lily: You're right. Tomorrow, that's what I'll do.
Marshall: Why not tomorrow?
Lily: I can not spoil the Tijuana Tuesday.
Barney is Ted at the bar.
Barney: Really? You really gonna sit and watch the door all night because Tiffany said she would try to pass?
Ted: I will not give up.
Ted : I should have quit.
Ted: This girl is special.
Ted : It was the devil!
Ted: It will get better with Tiffany.
Ted : No, moron!
Barney: Ted, let me be clear. That girl is poison and you have to forget your life forever.
Ted: There she is.  It has led to colleagues.
Barney: Hold on to it. Never lets go! I have never seen more beautiful girls. They all work with Tiffany?
Ted: Yep.
Barney: There can be only one explanation for that. Tiffany is a representative... e, pharmaceuticals?
Ted: How do you know?
Barney: And you never thought to say?
Ted: What? It's just a job.
Barney: That a b... Since time immemorial there has always been a professional edge to which girls g*n, like Tiffany, have flocked. I'll redo the story?
Ted: I will not say explicitly.
Barney: It began 2.5 million years ago. The man was a hunter.So the profession's sexiest moment? Picker. h*m* erectus, indeed. With improved technology, the profession's sexiest moment was changing. I'm sure it's a hernia. You can double-check? And then the man grabbed the heavens. So girls sexy stiletto heels began and became a flight attendant. I'm right and ready to fire. Then the man said, "Life is hard. I should start taking lots of drugs. " So sexy girls landed in medical offices, hot enough to make these pills erection ironically unnecessary. So today, girls are pharma's sexiest moment.
Tiffany: Hi my great darkness. How are you?
Ted: Okay. In fact, you've dumped your loser of guy?
Tiffany: No, sir.

Lily returned to the apartment while Marshall is sitting on the couch.
Marshall: I know you're having trouble dropping Scooter. I decided that you need training. And you say that the problem is his sad eyes?  Okay, shut up, woman. Now I want you to look this mini pig and you tell him it is impossible for you to be with him one day.
Lily: Mini Pig, it is impossible that I may one day with you. For now.
Marshall: Go! Be a man!
Lily: I'm sorry, but it is just so cute. I just want to cuddle him all day. Oh, yes.
Marshall: You know, it's funny. I remember when you told me stuff like that.
Lily: I still do.
Marshall: Not as much. Not as much.

Woman: Let's go have a drink.
Barney: It's over.
Robin: What?

Robin: It can wait.
Ted and Robin are at the bar when Barney comes.
Robin: How are you?
Ted: You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?
Barney: I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits.
Robin: Why change your mind?
