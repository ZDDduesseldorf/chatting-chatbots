Ted returned to his classroom with a student.
Student: Each week, a guy in a fraternity invites me to a party and I said "I am preparing my PhD and I write a thesis which is entitled Foreign Direct Investment and intergenerational ties of consumption behavior. "
Ted: And they will respond?
Student: "It's sexy. "

Lawyers, professors, poets, doctors, professional riders, and animators... A butcher, a baker, a candle maker. Yes, we got to the part where it rhymes. A teacher, a restorative, an observer... A puppeteer, a croupier, a housewife, it is also a job, guys. A circuit court judge...
Robin: Abbreviates!
Barney: I never, never slept with a barmaid sexy, until tonight.
Robin: It's not so sexy.
Ted: Would you jealous of the attention? Imagined would be the sexiest girl in the bar?
Robin: No. Shut up!
Barney: Wish me luck.
Lily: It will never happen. She will pretend to enjoy yourself in the same way she has mesmerized all these geniuses.

Marshall arrives.
Marshall: Guys, what's up?
Lily: A new super sexy barmaid.
Robin: You see? Marshall does not think she's sexy.
Lily: If he thinks. Do not bother to pretend that other women are not attractive just for my own good.
Marshall: I know, and if this woman was almost as sexy as mine, so I admit, but it is not the case.
Lily: Baby, you're an angel, but compared to this woman, I am a big trash bag 3 days.
Marshall: I say what I see, and... I think until you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
Lily: You see, it's really annoying.
Barmaid: You're so funny. It'll be $ 6.75.
Man: There's, 50, keep the change.
Barmaid: Thank you.
Barney: Amateurs.
Barmaid: What do you want?
Barney: Do not even try, baby. Wait, what?
Barmaid: You're going to stay there in order to be ridiculous?
Barney: Uh...
Barmaid: I do not know a Heu. It's half vodka and half-bar of yourself then?
Ted (2030): That night I went to a very important first date.
Ted is in the student with whom he spoke earlier.
Ted: How are you?
Student: Okay. Between.
Ted (2030): It's funny, sometimes you walk into an apartment for the first time, but it was the feeling of being right where it should be. And children, it was the first time I saw the little yellow bus of your mother. You know him. It is right behind you.
Ted: It's cute.
Student: Actually, this is my roommate.
Ted (2030): And so I was there in the apartment of your mother, except that I was dating her roommate, Cindy.
Ted: Sorry, I should not play with the affairs of your roommate.She look like?
Ted (2030): I do not know, but I would hear the first description of the woman I would marry.
Cindy: That is a whore. I think this is a dominatrix.
Ted: What?
Cindy: Okay, sorry, this is not true. I have a roommate complex.
Ted: Why?
Cindy: The guys always fall in love with her.
Ted: Look at me. I promise, I would not fall in love with your roommate.
Ted (2030): Oops!
At the bar, Marshall brings beers.
Lily: Now that you have been looking more closely, admit it: the bartender is the sexiest of the Bar.
Robin: The second sexiest.
Marshall: I repeat...
Lily: Baby, how can you not want you to do? I want to do it. If you do not wanna do it, sorry, but you must be gay.
Marshall: Yeah, I'm gay. Gay for you.
Barney: No matter. You understand why I'm the only guy she does not know this bar?

Cindy: And she has this weird habit of blackmailing his breakf.
Ted: It's weird.
Ted (2030): The version of "Memories" of your mother, sung by an English muffin, is to date the most beautiful thing I've heard in my life.

Cindy: Sorry. It is not so bad. I'm just a little jealous.

End flashback
Ted: She exaggerates, there, right?
Robin: Well, Ted, she's right.
Lily: And thoughtful. If the rules are so strict, you could put your work in.
Marshall: I think you should leave it, buddy.
Ted: Okay, I start again. She exaggerates, there, right?
Ted (2030): Of course they were right. I had to let her go, but as your uncle Barney was discovered, it is not always easy.

Barney: But I... Do it.
Tim: You do what it takes. Do not cry about it. It's silk.
Barney: Sorry. I know. I know.
Barney joined Marshall, Lily, Ted and Robin at the bar, with an urn in his hands.
Barney: We have the remains cremated. Its buttons have saved a sick jacket of the Upper East Side.
Robin: Finally, you can abandon the quest for so-called sexy barmaid.
Barney: No. My costume gave his life for this cause, and I do not should rest before these two... Well, it... Finally,... Be it mine.
Ted: There is absolutely right.
Lily: Who, the guy who kisses an urn full of ashes costume. This guy?
Ted: What if Cindy is the woman I am to marry, and I give up?Farewell, elegant but cozy house in Westchester, with a reasonable loan that I can pay without ruining me. Goodbye, the two children raised in a strict but loving hand, finding the perfect balance between the father and friend. Adios, triplets Schnauzers, Frank Lloyd Wright and. The fact is, I do not give up either! (Ted gets up and kissed the urn of Barney before leaving) I do not know why I did that.

Marshall: I can not. You're sexier than she.
Lily: That's a goddess! Her skin glows. Her legs are super long.And that ass? I do not mind having it, even on the head! That night, I admit, I thought about it a little more than once.
Marshall: What do you...? Kind, you think she is sexier than me?
Lily: I never said that.
Marshall: You think so!
Lily: It's not comparable. She is younger than you.
Marshall: I'm just, like, me, my friend, against it, its old.
Robin: You two, the fact that it is not real sexy! She is sexy thanks to circumstances! Look.
Robin takes off his jacket and goes behind the counter.
Marshall: I guess you also think she is sexier than me.
Carl: What are you doing?
Robin: What?
Carl: You do not have the right to be there.
Robin: Carl, listening. No. I do not want to leave. Mercy, mercy, do not force me to leave.
Carl: You have to go. You have to go.
Robin: I was someone there, behind! Everybody loved me.
Ted walking in the rain. A knock at Cindy.
Ted: Can we talk?
Cindy: My roommate is going out of the shower. Come into my room.
Ted: I know the law prohibits us from going out together. But he also says "Do not teach in having drunk" and I do it all the time.The fact is... I really appreciate you. You're cute, funny. You write a thesis which is entitled, Foreign direct investment and intergenerational ties of consumption behavior. It's too sexy! I know it sounds crazy, but... I feel that our paths are supposed to meet, and... I do not want to miss meeting you.
Cindy: I do not want it, me either.
Ted: I gotta tell you, just by looking at your room, I know we have much in common.
Cindy: Really?
Ted: The Unicorns? Who will cut our hair When We're Gone? I thought I was the only one with this album.
Cindy: This is my roommate. I borrowed.
Ted: And that? After World T.C Boyle?
Cindy: Birthday present... my roommate. I did not read it yet.
Ted: You should. It is really good. And that? It is the height. You play the bass? Seriously, ask my friends. I have always said that my perfect woman... does not play bass, because that is clearly that of your roommate.
Cindy: It is in a group.
Ted: Damn, that's cool.
Cindy: It's amazing. You chose the only three things that are here to my roommate.
Ted: The group played shows your roommate or...?
Cindy: Get out.
Ted (2030): Children, as you guessed, it was not the night I met your mother. Although I think I saw his foot. But I approached the meeting with the woman of my dreams. And your mother... She had recovered her yellow umbrella.
Barney the bartender back home.
Barney: It was so special, you know? We should observe a minute of silence. Followed by about 20 minutes of grunting.
Barmaid: I'll help you feel much better. Let me refresh.
Barney: Okay. Expected. No, this is not the bathroom. This is...
Barmaid: They are yours?
Barney: I'm the suit-sitting for someone.
Barmaid: Barney, you lied to me. You must choose immediately.Me... or costumes.
The barmaid hand.
Barney, singing and dancing in the street: I know what you're thinking, "What Barney has been drinking? This girl was hot! "I might have to do it, but I did not miss anything because there is something she is not. 10 would make me a lot, but I'd rather be on my 31. It is a fact that you can not deny. Nothing goes better than n'me costume! Imagine a world where men and women are perfectly well-dressed! The delivery man in suit and tie savate, this puppy in a cross! This guy with sideburns, this baby with a pacifier! This gendarmette deliciously beautiful. Nothing goes better than n'leur costume! A first officer that I can wear, they are oh so distinguished! The perfect trick to get me a girl with father issues, navy blue or black! (2 men get out of a store with a rack filled with costumes) spy on this perfect rack! I want to make guilis.
Marshall, doing the same: Oh, really! Then answer these questions, I beg. What would you do if you had to choose between your suits and a pot of gold?
Barney: Costumes!
Marshall: What would you say, against all your costume you were offered eternal youth?
Barney: Costumes!
Robin: What would you choose: a million girls and one three parts?
Barney: Do we see.
Lily: And a world at peace would be within your reach?
Barney: I'll stop. These are the costumes. Stops just bullshit.Two, three, four! Girls come and depart, but the clothes remain constant! Each buddy dépote and rambling, it is no substitute!Sorry, my costumes, I give you my life. My Sunday clothes are my best friends! The casual clothes go in the basket because nothing goes better with the undisputed often praised, claiming to fame... a true... Expect more... Costume...
Ted, Marshall, Lily: Nothing suits her better... than... Costume.In costume! In costume! Costume...!
Barney: Mind you, it is rather barrel. (Back at Barney) I choose you you, baby. Tomorrow morning, I get rid of these costumes.
Barmaid: Really?
Barney: Yeah. (They kiss) I will do you nothing!
