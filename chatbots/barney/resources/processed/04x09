t the bar...---"The naked guy" works! It will revolutionize the blows of an evening! It's like the forward pass in American football.Dunk the basketball. This stuff barber where they hold the wick and cut above. It changes everything!
Barney, this guy has slept with Robin, you say that being in love. How it makes you excited?---"The naked guy" is more important than me and Robin.

When I realized that there was no future in this relationship, I decided to do.---Great! OK, the important question: What will your pose "naked guy"?
