"No one played as well as Barney with this limit. A breeze for him.","I love traveling."
"Really? What is the best place that you hast visited?","Hawaii is fun. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. It's really not bad. But the best place? I must say, the moon."
"You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.","Ted, a blonde, it's easy."
"Flashback","Passed. Who wants to do something to 3? Lisa, wait."
"But I worked at a yogurt shop in high school. And indeed, it was... insane.","So, after 20 minutes, the eagle has landed. We fuse into space. Houston, we have a complainer. Other double entender related to space."
"Why are you lying all the time?","I do not lie! We made love, I have pictures!"
"Our coupons are your effigy.","I'm not saying he loves pizza, but the last time he went, the doctor said, ""stop eating pizza. ""Marshall:"" Why? ""Doc:"" To you examine. "" But seriously, we laugh because we love you."
"Did you get mugged?","Who? He wore a black hat and beard of the day? He said ""Hands up! ""?"
"It was downright terrifying.","It was downright terrifying."
"What are you doing?","I repeat. I will say that it happened to me to lie on compassion."
"Okay, you know what? We'll all calm down. We do not need a g*n. I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life.","I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. It's great. But I think I'll add a tear."
"Listen baby, I know it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine.You can put this behind us?","It's gold! But I'd rather say 'put me behind you. """
"I know. I know. Listen, I must confess something. This attack did not go exactly as I said.","So it was indeed a black bonnet. J'l'avais said!"
"He as*ault you naked?","I do not ask where he kept his w*apon."
"End flashback","31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!"
"Ted, Barney and Lily laugh at Marshall.","You've been mugged by a monkey?"
"This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us.","Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?"
"Hi, friends. What's new?","New information has been discovered on the attack on Marshall."
"Okay. That's what happened.","No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana..."
"I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well.","You're right. The banana was on the floor."
"Was not... Was not banana banana.","Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened."
"Barney entered the apartment while Ted is sitting on the couch.","I've just been mugged."
"What?","You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous."
"Neil? Neil!","Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar..."
"You've just mugged?","Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?"
"You're the lemon in your hair.","The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts..."
"Not at all.","So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet?"
"Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a g*n.","You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?"
"I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a w*apon. In truth, it never happened.","I can not believe."
"I would not?","If serious, this is too funny."
"Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends.","I, yes, but still."
"But I can not lie on national TV.","You know a long time. He told the truth?"
"I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.","I still say that it happened."
"Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.","Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body."
"It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.","False! They like to discover that they lied. ""Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth."" Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!"
"You mean what you done to him.","No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said."
"Yes, Neil?","It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied."
"This is the belt of Planar 3?","You know it."
"You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey.","Yeah! I knew it."
"Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.","Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that?"
"It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.","Dude, what do you do?"
"I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.","Now I want a w*apon."
"No! I have not been mugged!","You know if it was attacked?"
"Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.","It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good."
"Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.","Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way."
"It's really happening?","Of course, Ted."
