"I thought about it.","You think about it? You hardly know him. In addition, the guy is a draw with a job that is worthless."
"We have the same job, Barney.","And we could not be more proud of you, my angel."
"Why not let the solid brick to remind us not to buy?","All right. As a former... before you embark on anything, I'm meeting this guy. I think it's pretty weird not having yet met."
"Bluntly. It's as if someone was orchestrating things for this specific purpose. Okay, but you must promise to behave well.","I promise."
"Robin presented to Don Barney.","I'm doing this contortionist Portuguese, and I swear... it is so flexible, at a time, it was about me and beneath me. A top and a bottom! One and two! Which is empty?"
"Robin had never told Don she was out with Barney.","I appreciate you, Don. Both, we love a good scotch, one likes my stories compelling. And we went out with Robin."
"The'm not, it's as if we had never been together.","In short, the arms of the Erasmus student have dropped and there fell of my swing. Seriously, I have not found a girl who can do that from Robin."
"I came to apologize to you. I exaggerated.","Well, there you should also apologize. We said some pretty hurtful."
"Not at all.","That was after you to be part."
"It's great.","I can not wait, buddy."
"Don and Robin out of the bar.","I have to get Robin."
"Are you kidding?","I do not know what it is, but I want to get Robin."
"I know what it is. You're like... a kid who threw his toys and wants them back as soon as another plays with.","I had perhaps not done playing with. I just left to play with something else for a while."
"You ready.","Ready for what?"
"When Barney and Robin have broken in the fall before...","Hanging out with Robin was a huge mistake."
"Write it.","What?"
"Write yourself a letter. That way you will remember the reasons for the break when you miss.","My pleasure. Dear Barney... the future... This ink is too cool."
"Right?","You... and Robin..."
"End flashback",".. a couple were atrocious. It did not work. You always love Robin, but remember the other women... And above all, the other breast, and all the cool stuff you do with breasts... Y to the head, juggle... squeaker squeaker... I'm a hopeless romantic.And there are drawings of breasts."
"Get it?","I understand. I really want it back."
"Don made sushi, it's cool, huh? He learned in Japan.","It's too easy."
"Be nice. You want it just because you can not have it. Like saying ""Sit wherever you want, except on that chair."" You will be so...","My chair!"
"I do too. It is more spicy, the better.","Me too, man. More than you, certainly. Instance. Super spicy. I feel bad."
"It yes, with his personal trainer.","This pepper is an ice cube in my mouth."
"Don and Robin and Barney kiss between them.","Don Tokyo... You ever do that... in Japan? Wasabi!"
"Well, I hope you're happy.","I stay on my position. It was bold and romantic."
"You were emptied from the top and bottom.","Come on. Did you do stupid stuff to impress Robin."
"Yes, but not anymore, because I turned the page. Just like you.","You have not turned the page. You want it as much as me, but you not admit it."
"He fetches a box.","For my biographer?"
"I stole a blue french horn for her... I was with her for a year.I wanted her to be the mother of my children and spend eternity in his arms.",".. I want to sleep with her, at least one last time. She is mine!"
"It's not for you! And it's not mine, either. It is... to Don.","Okay. We must get rid of him. You know, metaphorically."
"Of course.","Or... literally. That's how it starts! I'm afraid, Teddy!"
"Ted and Barney are always quarreling about who will be Robin.","Robin Stinson!"
"Robin Mosby!","Robin Stinson!"
"Ted Scherbatsky. I would take his name. I do not care.","Okay, wait. What do you say to that? It is being shared?I take up to 40 years and after you can have it."
"Who we laugh? It is with Don. We must accept it and move on.","You're right. I go to you... I go to the bathroom. And then I'll break..."
"Robin's phone rings, she picks.","It's BarnExclussif."
"No. Ted, not quit. I'll remember. Ted is on the other line... and I think he has a problem.","Ted calls you? Indeed, he has a problem."
"We almost lose control.","It's true. I'm going to leave before something regrettable."
"Barney crying in the street.","Robin, I love you!"
"Species of bastard! I brought the blue French horn!","I brought the blue French horn! Ted has just given me.Sorry, I was there before you."
"Come on, get.","All right! Here we go! You, Me and Ted!"
"You abandoned easily. Game, set and match!","We won the fingers in the nose..."
"You're welcome. Good night, guys.","Good night, Dad."
"The Teddy Bear, BarnExclussif.","Dad?"
"We get up, f*ck. You remember last night?","Damn, Ted was torn. Embarrassing..."
"Ted joins Barney in MacLaren's.","So what's going on with Robin?"
"You were right, she was just angry. It's been four days and not talk to relocate. We must never repeat this kind of shit.","I agree. In fact... I even wrote another letter. Dear Barney the future, you think you want to get Robin, thou wilt not true. Let her. Sincerely, Barney's past."
"Let me see!","Give me that."
"Ps... The top was for Ted. He believed? Fine. Pull yourself together with Robin, but say nothing to Ted because he will still go wrong. And there are still drawings of breasts.","In my defense, the breasts, is not it great?"
