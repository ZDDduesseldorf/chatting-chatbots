"Barney enters the apartment where Ted is still trying to design a building.","What are you doing?"
"A hat-shaped building.","It's time to talk?"
"No.","Why?"
"I have to really work, so...","Awesome. Say that is a tailor and you have found a nice suit. A nice suit Canada. Superb chest. You try it, but it does not suit you perfectly. So you return it. Then I try it. I'm not too keen... a suit that you have caught the eye, but at the same time, I love this costume."
"Buy the costume. It is important to you. Tell him how you feel.","But Ted, remember your answer, because... The costume is Robin. I know! Okay?"
"I'm with you.","Now. As I explained..."
"Ted, Marshall and Barney are on the roof with an inflatable pool.","Forget it. It really is not class. At best, it sucks."
"It looks to be a... sacred... spa.","Owl. How do we go? We will do what? Jump?"
"An hour later... Marshall is always on the edge of the roof while Ted and Barney are in the pool.","Actually, it's not bad."
"This is the permission I needed.","Look, Robin... I must tell you something."
"Wait. Before that, I must tell you something.","What is it?"
"End flashback","So... when she said love me, she meant... otherwise."
"You said what?","In your opinion? What we can say to that?"
"Flashback","The costume is Robin. I know! Okay?"
"You must be right. Have fun.","You too, sweetie."
"What?","We're good friends. Why risk everything? Friends?"
"You were in love with her, throughout the year and when she feels the same, you love him more.","It's not great?"
"It is. It... is... go! It is.","Tracey, tell Lily what you just said."
"What I just arrived in New York?","No, how you've arrived there."
"I just get off the bus from Iowa.","Come off the bus from Iowa! How lucky that apprentice... dancer off the bus from Iowa... meeting... the producer of the Rockettes?"
"Honey, you're there. You're really there.","You can make us one of those rum and beer, that your father loves so much?"
"Damn.","What?"
"Everyone always says, ""Do not tell Lily. Lily can not keep a secret. ""And, usually, they are right. But this time I kept the secret. And here you come with that crap and you force me to become the Lily will spill the beans!","What song? There was a piece?"
"That's it. It worked well. You are back to normal.","Yes. It's true. And it's great. It's great. So Robin does not like me."
"Ted leaves the room followed by Marshall and Lily.","So... You're in love with me?"
"What? Yes. Much.","You can stop. Lily told me everything."
"Damn, Lily!","I can not believe it."
"It's just... You mean to me, Barney. And... This kind of stuff, the emotional side. This is not your type. I thought you avoid that.","Maybe I will not avoid it. I am perhaps. I have not wanted for a long time. But with you, it does not look so...difficult. I know not. I thought... you felt the same."
"Maybe. I know not. I am not good to face the feelings.There is clearly something... between us. Maybe my head said, ""stifles it in the bud"" because my heart said... something else. Listen... I feel for you. Maybe even that I love you.","It's going pretty fast, do not you think?"
"Friends.","My God. You just do it again. You've mosbys√©!"
"But no.","But if, little flirtatious."
"You're right. I've just mosbyser.","Why are you scared to try?"
"Because I'm afraid of how I could love you.","Bad idea."
"You're right. There must be a mistake.","No."
"I love you.","Friends."
"Friends, then.","I love you."
"Let's get married.","No, you're smothering me."
"They kiss.","You know what? We'll see later."
"I'll tell you, I will eat more chops.","Yeah, right."
