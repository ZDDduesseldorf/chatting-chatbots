    Grim and dark, lit by guttering candles. RAIN drums the

     Late. Lonely men and women loiter on the platform. At a
     food stand, patrons grimly read their TABLOID of choice.
     CAMERA TRACKS PAST The Daily Mail, The Sun, The Mirror --
     LANDS ON... the Daily Prophet. The SILHOUETTE. The
<b>     HEADLINE: "HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?"
</b>
     But the (unseen) reader is fixated on a   SMALLER ITEM,
     tucked at the bottom corner of the back   page: "Malfoy
     Sentenced to Azkaban." TWO PHOTOGRAPHS    accompany the
     piece, one of LUCIUS MALFOY, another of   Narcissa and
     DRACO MALFOY as they exit a courtroom.    Draco's eyes look
     distant, haunted.

     pretty.

     As she leans over to clear his chips wrappings, Harry's
     gaze drifts over the smooth skin of her neck, the spray
     of freckles across one cheek...

<b>                             WAITRESS

     She makes a face, smiles.   A smile to die for.    Starts to
     go.

     Harry watches her go, then quickly reaches into his coat

     looks. It FLICKERS again and this time a small cloud of
     GLITTERING DUST dances over the opposite platform. As a
     TRAIN ROARS past, Harry squints through the flickering
     windows and watches the dust transform into... ALBUS
     DUMBLEDORE. Leveling his glasses, he peers across the
     platform, smiles and gives Harry a wave.

     As Harry arrives, he finds Dumbledore studying a PERFUME
     ADVERTISEMENT which shows a MODEL with a WAND in her
     teeth: "Tonight Make a Little Magic With Your Man."

     Harry hesitates, notices Dumbledore's hand is ASH BLACK.

<b>                             DUMBLEDORE

     Harry glances across the platform, sees the freckled
     Waitress appear, eye his empty table. Slowly, he reaches
     out and -- instantly -- all goes BLACK in a RUSH of SOUND
     and FURY, as if Harry had been pitched headlong into a

     something is wrong about the place.

     Nothing. Dumbledore points his wand down a NARROW
     HALLWAY. Motes of dust dance in the wandlight, but
     nothing else. He starts down the hallway, toward the
     OPEN DOORWAY at its end. Slowly, the room beyond comes
<b>     INTO VIEW:

      Utter devastation. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK lays upon the
      floor, its face cracked. A PIANO sags in the corner,
      keys strewn like teeth upon the rug. A copy of the Daily
      Prophet trembles in the breeze from a half-open window.
      As Harry looks, a DROP of something WET strikes the word
      "CHOSEN." His gaze rises.

      He GASPS. A substance DARK and GLUTINOUS is spattered
      upon the ceiling. Dumbledore raises his wand. The
      ceiling SCREAMS RED. Another drop falls and this one
      strikes Harry's SCAR. As Harry moves to wipe it away,
      Dumbledore grabs his hand.

      Training his light on Harry's forehead, Dumbledore flicks
      a blackened finger over the scar. Brings it to his
      tongue. Reacts. Turning, his eyes narrow on an
      OVERSTUFFED ARMCHAIR. Moving to it, he JABS his wand
      into the plump seat cushion.

<b>                              ARMCHAIR

      Instantly, the Armchair mutates into HUMAN FORM, though
      briefly gets caught inbetween. After a bit of GRUMBLING,
      SEAM-SPLITTING and the POPPING of a cushion button or
      two, a FAT OLD MAN (HORACE SLUGHORN) in a pair of WELL-
      WORN lilac pajamas appears.

</b>      Slughorn takes a step back, having spotted Harry. The
      blood on Harry's forehead only serves to highlight his
      scar.

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                Ah yes. Introductions. Harry,
                this is an old friend and
                colleague of mine, Horace
                Slughorn. Horace, this is, well,

                     (a droll whisper)
                Apparently there's some thought he
                may be the Chosen One.

      Slughorn stares at Harry as if hypnotized.

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                So why all the theatrics, Horace?
                You weren't perhaps expecting
                someone else, were you?

<b>                              SLUGHORN

      Dumbledore raises an eyebrow.   Slughorn caves.

<b>                               SLUGHORN
</b>                Oh all right! The Death Eaters

                over a year. Do you know what
                that's like? One can only say no

      clock resumes its rightful place, shattered lanterns re-
      ignite and the blood on the ceiling evaporates -- just as
      the piano keys tumble back into place with a pleasant
      MUSICAL run.

                exceedingly bright -- your mother.
                Even more impressive when one
                considers she was Muggle-born.

      Harry steps forward, takes a picture of one particular
      BOY, a boy who resembles... Sirius. Seeing Harry thus
      distracted, he studies him intently, like a rare object.

<b>                               SLUGHORN

                along, of course, but I'd have

      Slughorn blinks, looks away from Harry and finds
      Dumbledore standing there, clutching a MUGGLE MAGAZINE.

                jewel. That is why he is
                returning to Hogwarts. And it is
                crucial he return...

      Harry looks intrigued by this last statement, but before
      he can pursue it, Dumbledore glances ruefully at the
      moon.

      A blood-red sun shimmers through the windows, staining
      the interior a deep scarlet. Students read, play cards.
      In one compartment, CRABBE and GOYLE slumber sloppily.
      As Harry enters, the ACCORDION doors to the NEXT CAR
      SQUALL open and a PAIR of TWIN GIRLS emerge. He watches
      them when a VOICE causes him to turn back. As the
      accordion doors slowly close, he spies Malfoy sitting
      with PANSY PARKINSON and a BOY with the cheekbones of a
      sphinx (BLAISE ZABINI).
      Harry studies Malfoy when a BOY pushes through the
      accordion doors. As they begin to close, slowly, Harry
      reaches into his pocket and removes the ORANGE AND BLACK
      LUMP Fred gave him in Diagon Alley. He eyes Malfoy, eyes
      the closing door and -- impulsively -- pitches the lump
      into the air. It soars through the narrowing crease of
      the doors and -- just as Malfoy glances his way -- just
      as it reaches the apex of its flight -- POOF! -- explodes
      softly, raining DARK POWDER.

      darkness eerily recedes, the red light of dusk returns
      and Malfoy is revealed, standing in the DOORWAY of the
      car. As he looks on warily, students return to their
      seats. Across the way, Crabbe & Goyle continue to
      slumber.

      Blaise shakes his head, smiling as he looks out the
      window at the darkness. Just then the small bag in the
      upper rack shifts. Malfoy's eyes play over it.

      Malfoy wheels, points his wand at the luggage rack.
      Something hits the floor with a THUMP. The Invisibility
      Cloak slips away and reveals Harry, paralyzed on the

      Malfoy brings his boot down hard on Harry's face. SNAP!
      Blood squirts from Harry's nose. Malfoy snatches up the
      Invisibility Cloak, pitches it over Harry.

                      eating)
                Sorting Hat urged us all to be
                brave and strong in these troubled
                times -- easy for it to say --
                it's a hat, isn't it? First Years
                seemed to enjoy it, though.
                Wankers. Filch give you the wand
                outside?

      Harry nods. Ginny, damp napkin in hand, begins to dab
      his face, then feels suddenly awkward. Harry takes it
      from her.

<b>                              HARRY
</b>                Thanks...
      Just then, the light in the Hall begins to gently dim and
      all eyes turn to Dumbledore, standing at the top of the
      Hall, ashen hand raised to the enchanted ceiling, where
      clouds respond to his gestures and shroud a gleaming full
      moon.

<b>                              HERMIONE
</b>                What's happened to his hand?

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                The very best of evenings to you!
                First off, please join me in
                welcoming the newest member of our
                staff, Horace Slughorn.

      MILD APPLAUSE ensues. Harry claps perfunctorily, his
      eyes drifting to the entrance of the Hall as a pair of
      Aurors station themselves just outside.
<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to
                say, has agreed to resume his old
                post of Potions master. Meanwhile
                the post of Defense Against the
                Dark Arts will be assumed by
                Professor Snape.

      This is greeted by stunned silence. Dumbledore frowns,
      then attempts to generate something by CLAPPING his hands
      once. A few Slytherins join in and some dim-witted First
      Years.

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                Now, as you know, each and every
                one of you was searched upon your

                to know why.

                 Once there was a young man who,
                 like you, sat in this very Hall.
                 Walked this castle's corridors.
                 Slept beneath its roof. He
                 seemed, to all the world, a
                 student like any other. His name?
                 Tom Riddle.

      The Hall goes utterly silent.

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                Today, of course, the world knows
                him by another name. Which is
                why, as I stand looking out upon
                you all tonight, I am reminded of
                a sobering fact. Each day, every
                hour, this very minute perhaps,
                dark forces attempt to penetrate
                this castle. But in the end,
                their greatest weapon remains...
                you.

      Harry eyes Malfoy, slouched low, lazily levitating a fork
      with his wand, as if Dumbledore were unworthy of
      attention.

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE

</b>
      A TEEMING MASS of STUDENTS fight their way to class on
      first day of term. Amidst it all, McGonagall stands tall
      and stern. The twins pass by, bearing identical looks of
      consternation.

                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                History of Magic is up, ladies,
                not down. Mr. Davies -- that's
                the girl's toilet...

      McGonagall's eyes shift, find Harry and Ron sitting upon
      a ledge, clearly deriving immense pleasure from the
      chaos.

                                PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                Potter!

<b>                              HARRY
</b>                This can't be good.

      Ron grins as Harry makes his way "upstream" to
      McGonagall.

                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                Enjoying ourself, are we?

<b>                              HARRY
</b>                Well, you see, I've got an open
                period this morning, Professor --

                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                So I noticed. I would think you'd
                want to fill it with Potions. Or
                is it no longer your ambition to
                become an Auror?

<b>                              HARRY
</b>                It is. Or was. But I was told I
                had to get an Outstanding in my
<b>                O.W.L. --
</b>
                               PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                And so you did when Professor
                Snape was teaching Potions.
                However, Professor Slughorn is
                perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T.
                students with `Exceeds
                Expectations.'

<b>                              HARRY
</b>                Really? Well... brilliant.    I'll
                head there straight away.

                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                Good. And take Weasley with you.
                He looks far too happy over there.

<b>43    INT. SLUGHORN'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - MORNING     43
</b>
      As Harry drags Ron inside, the other students turn in
      unison. Hermione frowns. Lavender, seeing Ron, beams.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                Harry m'boy! I was beginning to
                worry! And I see we've brought
                someone with us...

<b>                              RON
</b>                Ron Weasley, sir. But I'm dead
                awful at Potions, a menace
                actually, so I probably should
                just be going --

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                Nonsense, we'll sort you out. Any
                friend of Harry's is a friend of
                mine. Right then, books out --

<b>                              HARRY
</b>                Um, sorry, sir, but I haven't got
                my book yet -- nor's Ron. You
                see -- (until this morning...)                          

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                Not to worry. You can get what
                you need from the cupboard.

      As Harry and Ron step to the cupboard, Slughorn resumes,
      gesturing to the cauldrons bubbling before him.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                Now, as I was saying, I've
                prepared a few concoctions this
                morning. Any ideas what these
                might be? Yes, Miss...?

<b>                              HERMIONE
</b>                Granger, sir. That one there is
                Veritaserum. And that would be
                Polyjuice Potion. And that...

      In the cupboard, Harry and Ron find two TEXTBOOKS -- one
      new, one shabby and soiled. Both snatch for the new when
      a box -- marked "BEZOARS" -- tips. As Harry makes a grab
      for it, Ron wrests free the new textbook and goes off
      grinning.

<b>                              HERMIONE
</b>                ... is Amortentia! The most
                powerful love potion in the world.

</b>                 It's rumored to smell differently
                 to each person, according to what
                 attracts them. For example, I
                 smell freshly mown grass and
                 new parchment and spearmint
                 toothpaste --

      Hermione blushes, stops herself.    Slughorn regards her.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                One of my best friends is Muggle-
                born. She's the best in our
                year...
      Harry, settling into his seat with the soiled textbook,
      looks up just as Slughorn's eyes shift to him for
      confirmation. As Harry nods, Hermione glances curiously
      at him.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                Now Amortentia doesn't create
                actual love, of course. That's
                impossible. But it does cause a
                powerful infatuation or obsession.
                For that reason, it is probably
                the most dangerous potion in this
                room.

      Slughorn turns, finds a sea of dreamy faces leaning into
      the VAPORS. Instantly, he CLANGS a cover onto the
      cauldron, bringing them round. As Ron blinks, he finds
      Lavender still staring dreamily -- at him. Noticing,
      Hermione's eyes narrow.

<b>                              KATIE BELL
</b>                Sir, you haven't told us what's in

<b>                               SLUGHORN
</b>                Ah yes...

      Slughorn steps to a SMALL BLACK CAULDRON. Begins to
      ladle a bit of GOLDEN LIQUID into a TINY VIAL.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                What you see before you, ladies
                and gentlemen, is a curious little
                potion known as Felix Felicis.
                But it is more commonly referred
                to as --

      A buzz runs through the class.   Even Malfoy perks up.

                seven. Two tablespoons taken at
                breakfast. Two perfect days...

      Slughorn eyes the vial dreamily, adrift.   Finally he
      blinks.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                So. This is what I offer each of
                you today. One tiny vial of
                liquid luck... to the student who,
                in the hour that remains, manages
                to brew an acceptable Draught of
                Living Death, the recipe for which
                can be found on page ten of your
                textbook.

      Excitement seizes the class.   Slughorn smiles knowingly.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                You should know that in all the
                years of my previous tenure at
                Hogwarts, not once did a student
                brew a potion of sufficient
                quality to claim this prize. In
                any event -- good luck.

      Slughorn sets the vial upon his desk, where it SHIMMERS
      in a SHAFT of SUNLIGHT. Harry opens his book. Frowns.
      The MARGINS of the page before him are black with the
      tight SCRIBBLINGS of a previous owner.

</b>      The same CREEPY GRAFFITI fills the next page as well, on
      and on throughout the book. Shaking his head, Harry runs
      his finger under the first PRINTED INSTRUCTION:

      "Cut up one Sopophorous bean."

      Harry takes the SILVER DAGGER upon his desk, poises it
      over the BEAN when... Ron's bean shoots across the room
      and bounces off Katie Bell's head. Harry surveys the
      rest of the room: everyone is struggling to cut the
      resistant legume. He glances back to his book, considers
      the instruction again.

      As ARROW has been drawn from the word "Cut" to the
      margin, where a modification has been written in the
      tight scrawl:
      "Crush with blade -- releases juice better."

      Harry considers the dagger in his hand, then places the
      flat of the blade against the bean and presses.
      Instantly, the protective parchment covering the desk
      runs RED with juice.

<b>                             HERMIONE
</b>                No. The instructions specifically
                say to cut.

      Harry shrugs, lifts the parchment and tips the juice into
      his cauldron. It HISSES, then turns LILAC. Harry grins.
      CAMERA BEGINS SLOW DOLLY TOWARDS the vial of Felix
      Felicis and...

      Slughorn wends his way amongst the cauldrons, nodding
      with sympathy at the fiascos before him. Then... he
      stops, staring in disbelief at the pearly sheen of one
      bubbling potion.

      Slowly, Harry reaches out... takes the glittering vial.

      Dumbledore sits alone at his desk, the deep lines of his
      face illuminated by the shimmering PENSIEVE. TWO OBJECTS
      of note are before him. One is a BLACK-STONED RING. The
      other is TOM RIDDLE'S DIARY.

      finger, then turns a page of   the battered diary. His
      face is troubled. A KNOCK.     He takes the ring and diary,
      slips them inside a drawer.    The door swings open,
      reveals Harry.

      Dumbledore swings open a cabinet where DOZENS upon DOZENS

      Dumbledore reaches down with his damaged hand and removes
      a stoppered VIAL, dusty and veined with age.

      Dumbledore extends his ashen hand and Harry rises,
      gingerly takes the vial and removes the cork. He tips
      the contents into the Pensieve. Dumbledore nods and

      the surface...

</b>
      A skinny, sharp-featured woman, MRS. COLE, leads
      Dumbledore down a drab corridor. CHILDREN'S VOICES carry
      from an unseen COURTYARD, splashing and shrieking, in the          
      midst of some game.

<b>                              MRS. COLE
</b>                I must confess to a bit of
                confusion upon receiving your
                letter, Mr. Dumbledore. In all
                the years Tom's been here, he's
                never once had a family visitor.
                Frankly, I was stunned to find
                that someone knew of his
                existence.
<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                I am not family. But his name has
                been known to me since birth.

<b>                                MRS. COLE
</b>                I see...

      But she doesn't really.   She stops, frowns.

<b>                              MRS. COLE
</b>                I think I should tell you. He's a
                funny boy -- Tom. Odd. There
                have been incidents with the other
                children. Nasty things.

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                Perhaps you could give me an
                example.
      Mrs. Cole starts to speak, then shakes her head, moves
      off. As Dumbledore makes to follow, his eyes happen upon
      a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall, old and yellowing,
      depicting a SEASIDE SCENE of a SHARP ROCK OUTCROPPING and
      a CAVE. As he exits, we HOLD ON it.

      Mrs. Cole's hand appears.   KNOCKS.   She turns the KNOB.

      A small room, grim and shadowy. TOM RIDDLE, 11 years               
      old, sits atop a bed, hands in lap. The walls CRAWL with           
      REFLECTED RAIN, oozing like oil down a grimy window.

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE

      Riddle eyes Dumbledore briefly, looks away.

<b>                              MRS. COLE
</b>                Well, I'll leave you two to
                yourselves.

      Mrs. Cole exits, closing the door. Dumbledore studies
      Riddle, then begins to tour the room. Carefully placed
      upon a low shelf are some ODD SOUVENIRS. A grouping of
      SEVEN STONES... A book containing SEVEN MATCHES. SEVEN
<b>      BRASS KEYS...
</b>      Moving on, Dumbledore passes a TALL CABINET, tracing his
      FINGERS over its surface, as if the wood's grain were
      Braille, as if somehow "seeing" what lies within.

      Then Dumbledore pauses. Strewn on a small table are a
      grouping of SEVEN DARK DRAWINGS. A BOY and GIRL, their
      faces anguished. A sea-swept CAVE. The same cave from
      the photograph. Dumbledore begins to reach out...

<b>                                 TOM RIDDLE
</b>                Don't.

      Dumbledore stops, turns.    Finds Riddle's level gaze on
      him.

<b>                                 DUMBLEDORE
</b>                As you wish.

      Riddle looks away and Dumbledore, for the first time,
      notices his hands. They are splayed, utterly still, and
      INTERLACED with a SILKY WEB, where a SPIDER knits back
      and forth.

<b>                              TOM RIDDLE

<b>                              TOM RIDDLE

</b>                      (watching the spider)
                I can make things move -- without
                touching them. I can make animals
                do what I want without training
                them. I can make bad things
                happen to people who are mean to
                me. I can make them hurt... if I
                want.

      Dumbledore studies Riddle -- then the boy looks up.

                Open it. Open. It.

      Terrified, Riddle steps to the burning wardrobe and
      throws open the door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail
      of threadbare clothes, a SMALL BOX SHAKES VIOLENTLY.

<b>                               DUMBLEDORE

      As Riddle's fingers touch the box, the flames engulfing
      the wardrobe vanish, but the box continues to SHAKE --
      the only sound in the now-silent room.

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                Is there anything in that box you
                ought not to have?

      Riddle eyes Dumbledore, a trifle fearfully this time. He
      spills the box onto the bed: a YO-YO, a silver THIMBLE,
      and a tarnished MOUTH ORGAN.

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE

                to other people. It makes me feel
                ... close to them.

      Dumbledore studies Riddle's profile, pondering this.

      Dumbledore stops and we are ON his face, his back to
      Riddle.

      Dumbledore exits then, without a backward glance, leaving
      11-year-old Tom Riddle alone. The IMAGE SHUDDERS and...

      ... Harry and Dumbledore reappear. The room has grown
      DIM in their absence. Dumbledore gestures. LAMPS BLAZE
      to LIFE.
<b>                              HARRY

                time? No. Had I...

      Dumbledore falters, his expression troubled. Harry looks
      up from the Pensieve, where young Tom Riddle's fragmented
      face floats on the surface, eyes Dumbledore.

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                Over time, while here at   Hogwarts,
                Tom Riddle grew close to   one
                particular teacher. Can    you guess
                which teacher that might   be?
<b>                              HARRY
</b>                You didn't bring Professor
                Slughorn back simply to teach

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE

                something I desire very dearly.
                And he will not part with it
                easily...
                     (eyeing Harry
                      knowingly)
                I'd rather not divulge any more
                just yet, Harry. But I promise.
                In time you will know everything.

      Harry tries -- with little success -- to get the
      attention of the throng of aspiring Quidditch players
      assembled on the pitch.

      nevertheless.

                year does not guarantee you a spot
                this year. Is that clear?

      Ron looks unnerved at this, sweating so much he's
      attracted a PESKY FLY. CORMAC McLAGGEN, the huge boy
      from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, sidles up.

      Cormac nabs the FLY between two fingers, kills the BUZZ.

                getting on a first name basis,

      Cormac gives a lewd wink, saunters off.   Ron glances up
      to the stands. Hermione smiles, waves.


<b>      BEGIN MONTAGE
</b>
      Ginny flies swiftly, handling the Quaffle with ease.

      TWO SECOND YEARS collide in mid-air.

      Cormac makes a brilliant save.

      Ron makes a shaky save.

      Hermione looks on, nervous for him.

      Katie Bell snatches a Quaffle with one hand, splits two
      defenders beautifully and makes a slick blind pass to
      Dean who jets high in the air, then lets the Quaffle roll
      off his fingers... right into Ginny's hands as she races
      below.

      Seamus sends a Bludger rocketing into the stands,
      scatters a group of onlookers, leaving only Neville, who
      sidles delicately to the right as the others leg it.

      TWO THIRD YEARS collide in mid-air.

      Cormac makes a brilliant save.

      Ron turns the wrong way but makes the save anyway as the
      Quaffle caroms off the tail of his broom.

      Hermione looks on more nervously.

      Two aspiring Beaters "whiff" on a pair of Bludgers, whack
      each other instead and plummet to the pitch as the
      Bludgers ricochet off one another and go flying into the
      stands, scattering onlookers yet again and leaving, as
      before, only Neville. This time, he sidles delicately to
      the left.

      Cormac makes a brilliant save.

      The Quaffle bounces off Ron's head.

      Hermione looks on extremely nervously.

      TWO FIFTH YEARS collide in mid-air.
<b>      END MONTAGE.

<b>      ANOTHER ANGLE

      The survivors press ICE PACKS to their heads, run TAPE
      round twisted fingers. Only Ron, hovering at the west
      goal, and Cormac, hovering at the east, remain on the
      pitch. Luna, Spectrespecs in place, eyes Cormac -- cool,
      confident, clear. Then eyes Ron -- sweaty, nervous,
      SWARMING in WRACKSPURTS.

      Demelza and Ginny rocket forth. Ron weaves nervously
      while Cormac hovers in place, a confident sneer on his
      face.

      Demelza hunkers over her broom once again, flying like an
      arrow, then goes into a wide, sweeping slide. Ginny
      blasts over the pitch, ginger hair streaming like flames,
      then rolls recklessly to the side. As one, they both let
      fly...

      Hermione, face buried in her fingers, MUTTERS SOMETHING.

      Cormac, at the last moment, inexplicably rolls his broom
      to the right and the Quaffle sails over his shoulder.
      Ron, zig-zagging crazily, nearly falls off, rights
      himself in a panic, and deflects Ginny's Quaffle... with
      his forehead. As a few partisan CHEERS erupt from the
      stands, Harry grins, then has to restrain himself.
      Hermione opens her eyes slowly.

<b>                              LAVENDER BROWN

      Hermione stares balefully at Lavender, then notices
      Cormac eyeing his broom incredulously. She gets up,
      slips away.

</b>      HAGRID emerges out of the trees, beard crusted in white,
      looking like a crazed Father Christmas. Behind him, deep
      in the woods, DARK SILHOUETTES -- AURORS -- can be seen.
      Hermione eyes them briefly, then nods to the PULSATING
      BURLAP BAG Hagrid clutches in his fist.

      Hagrid crosses his fingers. Ron forces a grin, does the
      same, shakes his head as Hagrid disappears back into the
      trees.

      Just then Harry spies Slughorn, heading down towards the
      Village, passing a weary Flitwick coming the other way.

      As the trio enter, Harry glances round, locates Slughorn
      at the bar, planted plumply on a stool.

<b>                               HARRY

      Hermione and Ron, in the midst of seating themselves at a
      perfectly acceptable -- and clean -- table, see Harry
      seat himself at one strewn with the detritus of a
      previous customer -- but which puts him in direct view of
      Slughorn. They exchange a glance, shrug, join Harry.
      Ron starts to take the chair directly opposite Harry --
      blocking his view.

      A SKINNY KID in an apron appears, tosses a FILTHY RAG
      upon the table -- which begins to wipe the surface on its
      own. Harry cranes his neck around the kid to keep
      Slughorn in view.

<b>                              SKINNY KID

      The kid WHISTLES and the rag leaps back into his pocket.
      Harry continues to eye Slughorn, when he sees Draco.
      They lock eyes briefly, then Draco exits.

      Slughorn's voice BOOMS so loudly even Ginny jumps -- and
      catches Harry looking. As Slughorn waddles over,
      SLOSHING mug in hand, Harry rises immediately -- an
      action so grossly out of character that Hermione regards
      him with amused curiosity.

<b>                               HARRY

                it was simply One Broomstick!

      As Slughorn GUFFAWS, Harry joins in, LAUGHING HEARTILY as
      well. Slughorn's belly trembles next to Hermione's cheek
      and his waving mug sloshes over, spattering the table.

      Hermione smiles thinly, when a WHISTLE is heard and the
      FILTHY RAG is back, whisking away Slughorn's mess as the
      SKINNY KID slides three foaming mugs onto the table.

      remains eerily placid. Then she... SCREAMS. Harry and
      Ron DASH FORWARD, seize her ankles. At their touch, she
      FALLS to the snow, THRASHING and SHRIEKING, EYES ROLLED
      UP in her skull.

      Effortlessly, he scoops up Katie's thrashing body and

      limp.

      Hagrid nods darkly to the package in the snow. Harry
      kneels. Poking through the paper is an ORNATE OPAL
      NECKLACE. Taking off his scarf he carefully enfolds
      package and rises. Then, along with the others, he
      watches Hagrid lumber off, Katie cradled in his arms. In
      seconds they are swallowed by the snow. The only sound
      is the ROAR of the WIND.

                unlike the others I've known. In
                fact, not unlike... you. If the
                monster existed, it was buried
                deep within.

      As Seamus peels off, Ron cuts his eyes toward the
      Slytherin table, where the Quidditch team sits together.
      One Slytherin juts his chin toward Ron, MUTTERS
      something. A few turn, snigger. Ron averts his eyes
      and... almost runs into Cormac, who eyes him with disdain
      as he passes. Frowning, Ron drops down opposite Harry
      and Hermione. Harry eyes him briefly, knowingly, pushes
      a plate across. Ron takes a fork, pokes at it glumly.

      Instantly, Slytherin snatches the Quaffle and rushes en
      masse toward Gryffindor's end, weaving and passing with
      wicked skill, culminating in a vicious, slicing shot on
      goal. Just when it appears it will clear the hoop, Ron
      streaks out of nowhere and sends the Quaffle screaming in
      the opposite direction. Ginny pauses on her broom,
      stunned.

</b>                Ginny!    Let's go!

      Instantly, she rolls backward, jets off and races down
      her fellow Chasers. Flying in spread formation, Dean --
      on the far wing -- starts the Quaffle "up the line" until
      it lands in Ginny's hand.

      where Luna's LION HAT ROARS, Lavender CLAPS for Ron and
      Hermione sits with her arms crossed, a look of supreme

      Hermione sits atop a desk, a small ring of TWITTERING
      BIRDS circling her head. The birds change color as they
      orbit, from sunny yellow to a dark, angry scarlet.

      Just then the DOOR BURSTS WIDE and Ron rushes in, pulling
      a GIGGLING Lavender by the hand. They stop. Take
      inventory.

      FEATHER CLOUDS and Hermione covers her face and SOBS.
      Harry goes to her, hesitates, then tentatively drapes his
      arm over her. As she turns her face into his chest, he
      pulls her closer, watching as, across the room, the last
      scarlet feather drifts to the floor, joining the pool
      already there.

      THROUGH the icy window, we see Harry cradling Hermione
      within. As CAMERA DRIFTS AWAY, RISING THROUGH the
      FALLING SNOW, the VIEW EXPANDS. In the Common Room, the
      party rages on, while three windows down, Lavender pulls
      Ron into a kiss. Figures pass by windows, including one
      tall, pale boy standing at a WINDOW on the SEVENTH FLOOR:
      Malfoy. As he turns away, the castle slides FROM VIEW
      and the CAMERA TILTS UP TO the sky, drifting with snow.

      Tinsel decks the banisters and mistletoe droops from the
      ceiling. As Ron and Harry make their way down the
      crowded corridor, passing the BIRDCAGE, Ron walks with a

      the cabinet and places it within. Shuts it. Closing his
      eyes, he MUTTERS a LOW INCANTATION, barely discernible.

      He reaches out. Opens it. The apple is gone. He closes
      the cabinet again. Waits. Longer this time. Finally,
      he opens it. Removes the apple. Rotates it.

      Someone has taken a BITE out of it.

      Slughorn before a PHOTOGRAPHER (ADRIAN). The ceiling and
      walls are draped with HANGINGS of emerald, crimson and
      gold, so the room feels like a tent... or the inside of a
      gift box. It is LOUD and packed with people.

                hoped for more out of him, but at
                least the pictures are in focus.
                     (suddenly)
                Oh my! Excuse me, Harry. I must
                greet the new Minister of Magical
                Transportation. Class of `67.

                Mingle, m'boy! Mingle! We're all
                friends here. And we run the
                world.

      Harry watches Slughorn make a beeline across the room,
      along the way nodding to the twins, who have apparently
      come with each other.

      Harry looks past Cormac's shoulder, out past the hanging
      and sees Slughorn laughing with a guest. Cormac plucks a
      dragon blob off the tray in Harry's hand, pops it.

      Cormac SPEWS raw dragon all over Snape's shoes.   Snape

      Snape merely stares a Harry silently, briefly, then
      exits, taking Harry's gaze with him, to Slughorn once
      again, wildly gesturing with a full glass of wine.

      A frown overtakes Slughorn's face and he turns toward the
      source of the commotion, exits Harry's view. Harry
      emerges from the hanging, finds Malfoy in Filch's rough
      grip.

      which is chock-a-block with MUGGLE OBJECTS: Steam irons.
      Toasters. Clock radios. Plugs. Lots of plugs. The
      PARTY can still be heard, drifting faintly from the main

                You can imagine the appeal.
                Should the Death Eaters come
                calling, one needed only slip
                inside and disappear for an hour
                or two. But they're tricky
                contraptions. Require a
                tremendous amount of looking
                after. Eventually they fell out

                times -- do funny things to
                people. It can bring them
                together and it can tear them
                apart. Things... speed up. It's
                what happens when you don't know

      Harry bursts through the front door, wand drawn, pelts

      Fred, George, Ron and Arthur fan out, running full-out,

      Bellatrix leads Harry on, grinning madly.

      Ginny comes dashing to a halt, chest heaving as she peers
      into the smoking marsh. A HUGE FIGURE QUIVERS through a
      veil of smoke. Ginny's eyes SHIFT, see Bellatrix racing
      forward through the reeds, then SHIFT back as the veil of
      smoke evaporates, reveals... Greyback. Bellatrix makes
      an ODD, CLICKING noise -- like a signal -- and Greyback
      edges forward, sweeping away the reeds in front of him
      and revealing...

      ... Harry as he pelts forward.

      Harry falters, looking toward Ginny's voice and spies
      Greyback. Bellatrix stops dead, wheels in her tracks
      and, seeing Ginny, SHRIEKS with RAGE. Raising her wand,
      she fires a BOLT of RED LIGHT which explodes in a SHOWER
      of SPARKS around Ginny. Ginny fires back, then wheels
      away, flashing through the reeds and coming face to face
      with...

      Greyback, sharp teeth glittering.

      Just then, TWIN BOLTS of light blast from opposite sides
      of the clearing and Greyback is lifted in the air,
      slammed to the ground. As he regains his feet he looks
      into the reeds and sees Harry and Ginny, wands poised.
      He grins... when Bellatrix's odd, CLICKING signal carries
      through the night once again. Turning away, he exits.

      Harry and Ginny slowly step out of the reeds, stare at
      each other wordlessly. Then... Ron, Fred, George, Arthur
      and Lupin come thrashing into the clearing, stop. All
      around them, the reeds SMOKE, the flames dying. Across
      the marsh, Bellatrix's cackle rises briefly on the air --
      then all is quiet.

                detention. Lestrange, Avery,
                don't forget your essays...

      As the others file out, Slughorn busies himself with some
      papers when -- Ping! -- he turns, finds Riddle still
      there, standing by the crystal hourglass.

                to be caught out of bed after
                hours...

<b>                              TOM RIDDLE
</b>                Yes, sir. I couldn't think of
                anyone else to go to. The other
                professors, well, they're not like
                you. They might... misunderstand.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                Go on.

      Riddle slips off the RING on his left hand, begins to
      roll it between his fingers. It is set with a BLACK
<b>      STONE.
</b>
<b>                              TOM RIDDLE

                and I read something rather odd,
                about a bit of rare magic, and I
                thought perhaps you could
                illuminate me...

      Suddenly, a DENSE FOG engulfs the room and SLUGHORN'S
      VOICE twists into an ANGRY SHRIEK:

      ... CAMERA EMERGES FROM the swirling Pensieve. Harry
      blinks, finds Dumbledore studying him from across the
      room.

<b>                             DUMBLEDORE
</b>                Confused? I would be surprised if
                you weren't.

<b>                              HARRY
</b>                I don't understand -- what
                happened?

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                This is perhaps the most important

                a lie.
                     (off Harry's look)
                This memory has been tampered
                with. In this case by the person
                whose memory it is, our friend
                Professor Slughorn.

<b>                              HARRY
</b>                But why would he tamper with his
                own memory?

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                I suspect he is ashamed of it.

<b>                              HARRY
</b>                Why?

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                Why indeed.

      Dumbledore trails his withered fingers in the Pensieve.

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                I asked you to get to know

                 divulge his true memory. Any way

</b>                You're the Chosen One, Harry. And
                Horace is, at heart, a decent man.
                Provide the proper circumstances
                and he will confess his sins.

      Dumbledore lifts his fingers from the Pensieve, studies
      them. They are, in this moment, iridescent, whole.

<b>                              DUMBLEDORE
</b>                This memory is everything, Harry.
                Without it, we are blind. Without
                it, we leave the fate of our world
                to chance. You have no choice.
                You must not fail.

      As Harry watches, the damp sheen enveloping Dumbledore's
      hand evaporates and once again his fingers decay.

      As the CLASS BELL RINGS, a group of FIRST YEARS rise.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                Now don't forget to look over the

                Don't forget your rattails, Miss
                Alys.

      As the tiny ones scurry out, Harry is revealed, waiting
      just outside the door. He enters. For a moment,
      Slughorn merely HUMS over his briefcase, unaware.
      Then...

</b><b>                              HARRY
</b>                Well, you see, the other day I was
                in the Restricted Section -- in
                the library -- and I stumbled upon
                something rather odd while
                reading. Something about a bit of
                rare magic...

<b>                             SLUGHORN
</b>                Yes? And exactly what was this
                rare magic.

<b>                              HARRY
</b>                I'm not sure... That is, I don't
                recall the name... exactly. But
                it got me wondering... Are there
                some kinds of magic you're not
                allowed to teach?

      Slughorn looks up, eyes Harry carefully.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                I'm a Potions Professor, Harry.
                Perhaps your question would best
                be posed to Professor Snape.

<b>                              HARRY
</b>                Yes, well, we don't exactly see
                eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to
                say is, he's not like you. He
                might... misunderstand.

      Recognition flickers in Slughorn's eyes.   A glint of
      fear.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                There can be no light without the
                dark. And so it is with magic.
                Myself, I have always strived to
                live within the light. I suggest
                you do the same.

      Slughorn gathers his briefcase, starts to exit.

<b>                              HARRY
</b>                Did you say the same to Tom
                Riddle, sir? When he came asking
                questions.

      Slughorn freezes in the doorway, then slowly turns.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                Dumbledore put you up to this.
                Didn't he? Didn't he!

      Slughorn silences him with an upraised hand.   Then,
      without another word, he is gone.

      Lightning flashes. Thunder rumbles. Rain lashes the
      windows. Through the birdcage's grid of wires someone
      approaches. We RACK FOCUS... FIND Harry. As he passes,
      we HOLD ON the cage. One bird is missing. Only the
      BLACK one remains. As thunder BOOMS, the bird RUFFLES
      its feathers.

      Harry glances down the corridor adjacent, sees a FIGURE
      start up the far stairwell. As the SHADOW ASCENDS, Harry
      follows.

      looks back the way he came. HARRY'S SHADOW scales the
      wall as he approaches. Draco watches calmly, then turns,
      CLOSES HIS EYES. And simply... DISAPPEARS.

      Harry turns the corner.    Stops.   No one.

      Draco wends his way through the towering shelves, removes
      the tapestry and faces the gleaming cabinet. He reaches
      into his coat and carefully removes the WHITE BIRD.
      Holding it in one hand, he studies it, gently stroking
      its feathers with the other. For a moment, he seems lost
      in the activity, lost in the bird's coal black eyes, its
      bobbing head. Then, gently, he places it in the cabinet
      and closes the door. Waits.

      When he opens the cabinet, the bird is gone.   He closes
      the cabinet once more.

      jacket. He takes it, turns it in the light. It is
      fragile, translucent. He looks briefly lost again, then
      blinks, turns back to the cabinet, slowly reaches out and
      opens it. The bird is there.

      Dead.

      away.

      Harry stops rubbing his head, eyes Ron oddly, then
      glances at the candy box at his feet. There is an
      envelope. Taking it, he slides out a card: "Dear Harry.
      Thinking sweet thoughts of you. Happy Valentine's Day.
      Romilda." He suppresses a smile.

      DRESSING GOWN and matching NIGHTCAP, looking bleary-eyed
      and annoyed. Something SMOKES on the floor behind him --
      the FLOOR LAMP he'd sent wobbling the night of the dinner

      Slughorn squints over Harry's shoulder at Ron who is
      doing precisely the same from the other side.

</b>      Slughorn, with practiced ease, mixes a concoction of
      powders and potions into a goblet while Ron peers into a
      mirror. As he paces, Harry passes "the shelf" and finds,
      front and center, a PHOTOGRAPH of himself and Slughorn --
      the one taken at the Christmas party. In deep b.g. is
      photograph of Snape, as a young student, clutching his

</b>                Hm.   Perhaps you're right.

      furtively.

</b>                I'm sorry, sir. About the other

      Slughorn's mixing hand falters instantly.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                I'll ask you not to use that name.

      Slughorn's stare is fierce. Finally, he turns, goblet in
      hand, and puts a smile on his face, his voice cheery.

                a name only increases fear of the
                thing itself. It seemed sensible.

<b>                              SLUGHORN
</b>                With all due respect, Dumbledore
                sometimes forgets that most of us
                do not possess powers so great
                that we can risk offending the
                most dangerous Dark Lord who ever
                lived.

      Slughorn's stare is fierce, as fierce as the one
      Dumbledore fixed Harry with. Finally, he turns away.

      Slughorn takes a STOUT BOTTLE and fills a glass for Ron.
      As Ron SIPS, Slughorn fills a pair for he and Harry.

      his knees, then tumbles full out on the rug, SPASMING
      horribly, FOAM oozing over his lips. Harry rushes to
      him.

</b>      Harry glances about, then leaps up, and frantically
      begins to strip the walls of its potion stores, looking
      for something, anything. A box tumbles, something
      spills: a scattering of stones, no bigger than a robin's
      egg, shriveled and dry. Snatching one, he wrenches open
      Ron's jaw and THRUSTS it deep into his THROAT. Instantly
      Ron stops moving, paralyzed. The room is suddenly
      silent. He's not breathing. Harry places both hands
      behind Ron's head and gives it a SHAKE. Another.

      Harry shakes him again and again... then stops. Ron's
      head rolls limply from his fingers. Slughorn looks on,
      mouth agape. Useless. Then... A COUGH, a great
      hiccupping COUGH -- like a swimmer almost drowned -- and

        Harry pauses on his soup, exchanges a glance with
        Hermione, who carefully withdraws her hand from Ron's.

        As one, the three glance over at Lavender and are
        rewarded with a lethal squint.

                  But no. It can't be. Besides, I
                  was completely boggled, wasn't I?

<b>                                 HERMIONE
</b>                  Right.   Boggled...

        Hermione slumps back, frowning. Harry smiles with
        amusement. Just then, a MILD COMMOTION draws his
        attention. At the back of the Hall, a group of girls
        surrounds a new arrival.

        Katie Bell, pale but smiling, greets the other girls.
        After a moment, she looks up. Finds Harry standing
        before her.

        then:

        Katie's eyes shift. She goes ashen. Harry turns,
        follows her gaze and finds... Malfoy, staring at her.
        Katie backs away, retreating to the other girls. Harry
        watches her go, then looks back. Catches Malfoy fleeing
        the Hall.

        Malfoy hurtles past, forehead gleaming with sweat, passes
        OUT OF FRAME. Seconds later, Harry appears, follows. As
        he passes the birdcage... we HOLD. It's now EMPTY.

        Malfoy lurches to the mirror, steadies himself against
        the sink. Then, with a great, heaving shudder begins
        to... CRY.

        In the MIRROR, we see the bathroom DOOR ease open:
        Harry. He stops, stunned. Malfoy's eyes shift.
        Horrified to be exposed. He wheels, points his wand.
        WHOOSH! The LAMP next to Harry's head SHATTERS. FLAMES
        spider up the ceiling.

        Harry draws his own wand, fires back. The CISTERN behind
        Malfoy EXPLODES and WATER sweeps the ceiling, rains down.
        Malfoy HOWLS with RAGE. Harry readies himself.

        through the white of his shirt. He    staggers, HOWLS again
        and COLLAPSES. Harry glares at his    wand in horror, then
        slushes across the floor, the water   running red with
        Malfoy's blood.

        Harry stops dead... transfixed by a FLASH of SOMETHING
        DARK pushing through the wet fabric of Malfoy's
        shirtsleeve. Just then... Snape BURSTS THROUGH THE DOOR.
        Seeing Malfoy -- and the nature of his injuries -- he
        eyes Harry with keen curiosity. Kneeling, he traces the
        TIP of his WAND over Malfoy's wounds, MURMURING an EERIE
        INCANTATION. Instantly, the skin begins to knit itself
        together. Harry backs away, Snape's ancient CHANT
        ringing in his ears, blood floating like crimson flowers
        on the floor, backing away until he reaches the door...

</b>        Harry sits numbly, the Potions textbook lying limp in his
        hand. Hermione, Ron and Ginny sit together, a bit apart,
        keeping a kind of vigil. Finally, Ginny rises, steps to
        him.

        Harry, Potions book in hand, follows Ginny past the empty        
        birdcage and down the corridor when she pauses, turns to         
        the wall and shuts her eyes.

        Ginny nods, turns away.   Harry follows.

</b>
        Harry eyes the shelves that tower above him and the odd
        things they hold: a SMALL CAGE bearing the SKELETON of
        some long-dead creature. A JAR of QUIVERING EYEBALLS
        which track him as he passes.

                  something, this is where they
                  came. Some of these things are
                  almost as old as the castle

        As Ginny drifts in the memory, Harry studies her, then a
        SCUFFLING SOUND is heard nearby. They turn, look off.

        Harry and Ginny approach. The SCUFFLING GROWS LOUDER.
        Harry reaches out, pulls aside the tapestry. Reacts.
        The cabinet door VIBRATES. Slowly, he opens it and...

        ... the BLACK BIRD flies free in a rush of FLAPPING
        wings.

        Ginny slips the book from his fingers and starts to back
        away. She mouths: Close... your... eyes. As she leaves
        FRAME, CAMERA PUSHES EVER-SO-SLOWLY IN ON Harry. Still.
        Waiting. For a long moment, there is only silence. Then
        a shadow gently eclipses Harry's face.

        Harry opens his eyes, watches Ginny back away, then
        disappear around the corner. He stares at the empty air,
        blinking, then watches the black bird flutter overhead.

        KNEELS, considers a BEETLE on its back, legs churning

       beast's body... and sends him tumbling into the freshly-
       dug grave adjacent with a SICKENING THUNK.

        Harry, Hagrid and Slughorn sit at the massive kitchen
        table, which is strewn with EMPTY WINE BOTTLES. Hagrid

                  two, which was sad...

        everyone's mug with a bit more wine. Harry brings his
        mug to his lap... then slyly pours it into the bucket at
        his feet.

        Thunk! Hagrid's great shaggy head hits the table.
        Instantly, he is SNORING, so DEEPLY his MUG shimmies
        across the table. Slughorn smiles, regards Harry, who
        merely stares back. Slughorn averts his eyes. Suddenly
        nervous. A WIND rises outside. Windowpanes rattle.

                  Francis. One spring afternoon I
                  discovered a bowl upon my desk
                  with a few inches of clear water.
                  There was a flower petal floating
                  upon the surface. As I watched,
                  the petal sank, but just before it
                  touched bottom... it transformed.
                  Into a wee fish. It was beautiful
                  magic, wondrous to behold. The
                  petal had come from a lily.

        Hearing "lily," Harry looks up.   Slughorn nods.

        take it. Slowly, Slughorn    raises his wand, touches it to

        at the orphanage, of the CAVE and the distinct
        OUTCROPPING. Then... the pearl drops.


<b>116     FLASHBACK - INT. SLUGHORN'S OFFICE - NIGHT (YEARS PAST)      116
</b>        As before. The CRACKLING EMBERS of the FIRE.     Slughorn,
        a circle of six. Riddle commanding the room.

<b>                                TOM RIDDLE
</b>                  Sir, is it true that Professor
                  Merrythought is retiring?

        Slughorn chuckles, wags a sugar-encrusted finger at
        Riddle.

<b>                                 SLUGHORN
</b>                  Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I
                  knew, could I? I must say, m'boy,
                  I'd like to know where you get
                  your information. More
                  knowledgable than half the staff,
                  you are.
                        (as the other boys
                         laugh)
                  By the way, thank you for the
                  pineapple -- you're quite right,
                  it is my favorite -- how is it you
                  knew?

<b>                                 TOM RIDDLE

</b>                       (an uneasy chuckle)
                  Good gracious, is it that time
                  already? Off you go, boys, or
                  Professor Dippett will have us all
                  in detention. Lestrange, Avery,
                  don't forget your essays...

        The others exit, when -- PING! -- Slughorn turns, eyes
        the hourglass, finds Tom Riddle still there.

                  on your mind, Tom?

<b>                                TOM RIDDLE
</b>                  Yes, sir. I couldn't think of
                  anyone else to go to. The other
                  Professors, well, they're not like
                  you. They might... misunderstand.
<b>                                SLUGHORN
</b>                  Go on.

<b>                                TOM RIDDLE
</b>                  I was in the library the other
                  night, in the Restricted section,
                  and I read something rather odd,
                  about a bit of rare magic and I
                  thought perhaps you could
                  illuminate me. It's called, as I
                  understand it... a Horcrux.

        Slughorn's weak smile evaporates altogether.

<b>                                SLUGHORN
</b>                  Excuse me?

<b>                                 TOM RIDDLE
</b>                  Horcrux. I came across the term
                  while reading and I didn't fully
                  understand it.

<b>                                SLUGHORN
</b>                  I'm not sure what you were
                  reading, Tom, but that's very Dark
                  stuff, very Dark indeed.

<b>                                TOM RIDDLE
</b>                  Yes, sir. Which is why I came to
                  you. I mean no disrespect to the
                  rest of the staff, but I thought
                  if anyone could tell me... it
                  would be you.

        Slughorn frowns, clearly disturbed, then speaks quietly.

</b><b>                                SLUGHORN
</b>                  A Horcrux is an object in which a
                  person has concealed part of their
                  soul.

<b>                                TOM RIDDLE
</b>                  Yes, I thought it might be
                  something like that. But I don't
                  understand how that works, sir.

<b>                                SLUGHORN
</b>                  One splits one's soul and hides
                  part of it in an object. By doing
                  so, you are protected should you
                  be attacked and your body
                  destroyed.
<b>                                TOM RIDDLE

                  you cannot die.

        Riddle nods and TURNS AWAY, staring at himself in the
        MIRROR on the wall opposite. A hint of RED glints in his
        eyes.

<b>                                TOM RIDDLE

<b>                                SLUGHORN
</b>                  I think you can guess the answer
                  to that, Tom.
<b>                                TOM RIDDLE
</b>                  Murder.

<b>                                SLUGHORN
</b>                  Yes. Killing rips the soul apart.
                  It is a violation against nature.
                  After, one is never the same.

<b>                                TOM RIDDLE
</b>                  Out of curiosity, sir -- can you
                  only split your soul once? For
                  instance, isn't seven the most
                  powerfully magical number --

<b>                                SLUGHORN

        Dumbledore holds up his withered hand, silencing him,
        turns away. Harry studies him, waiting, the hush
        palpable.

        Dumbledore looks off, his eyes distant. Harry watches
        him intently, as do the HEADMASTERS in their frames
        above. Finally, tentatively, Harry speaks.

<b>                                HARRY

        Riddle's battered DIARY.

                  of magic. Very dark. Very
                  powerful. But until tonight, I

                        hand)
                  ... even more difficult to

<b>                                HARRY

        VOLDEMORT'S FACE, twisted in pain. A DERELICT HOUSE,
        deep in a haunted clearing. An ANCIENT CUP, gleaming as
        it tumbles from an old woman's hand. A SNAKE (NAGINI)
        slithering through damp grass. Dumbledore slipping the
        ring onto his finger, recoiling as his skin decays...

        skitters across Dumbledore's desk and Harry brings a hand
        to his chest, a look of bewilderment on his face.
        Dumbledore watches the ring spin down, then glances at
        Harry and slowly extends his own hand, lightly touching
        the center of Harry's chest with the tips of ashen
        fingers, as if reading braille, as if he can somehow
        "see" into Harry's heart. Trepidation -- and recognition
        -- flicker over his face.

        Harry's eyes drift once again to the postcard on the
        desk. Dumbledore withdraws his hand, nodding, still
        studying Harry oddly, his voice, when it comes, distant.

<b>                                DUMBLEDORE

                  time I cannot hope to destroy it
                  alone.
        Harry peers into Dumbledore's eyes.   Dumbledore nods.

        Just then, the twins appear, pass.    Harry watches them, a
        thought forming.

<b>                                HARRY

        Harry watches the twins vanish around a corner.

<b>                                RON
</b>                  Good luck, mate.

        Harry turns back to Ron and Hermione, neither able to
        fully conceal heir concern. He smiles reassuringly,
        continues on.

</b>
        As Harry trots up the spiraling exterior stairs, he hears
        VOICES coming from the topmost level and pauses, peering
        up through the grid-like floor above: Dumbledore and
        Snape.

<b>                                SNAPE
</b>                  Have you ever considered that you
                  ask too much? That you take too
                  much for granted? Has it ever
                  crossed your brilliant mind that I
                  don't want to do this anymore?

<b>                                DUMBLEDORE
</b>                  Whether it has or hasn't is
                  irrelevant. I will not negotiate
                  this with you, Severus. You
                  agreed. There's nothing more to
                  discuss.

        Harry stands poised, peering upward, where Dumbledore
        squints toward the dying sun and Snape glares at his
        back. Finally, Snape turns away and -- before Harry can
        react -- is descending the stairs. Seeing Harry, Snape
        falters briefly, then continues on without a word. As
        his FOOTSTEPS fade, Harry ascends to the upper tier.
        Dumbledore turns. Smiles.

<b>                               DUMBLEDORE
</b>                  Harry. You need a shave, my

        Harry runs his hand over his face.

                  Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. I

       BLACK. Undulating. The sound of WAVES. We EASE UP, out
       of the ocean. A GIANT WAVE crashes over a jagged
       outcropping. As the SPRAY clears... Dumbledore and Harry
       are revealed. Dumbledore eyes the TOWERING CLIFF FACE
       opposite, the CAVE.

        Harry and Dumbledore materialize. It is quiet here,
        eerily so, the waves merely distant thunder. As Harry
        glances about, Dumbledore moves to an archway, passes
        beyond. Harry follows, finds Dumbledore standing below a
        towering dome of rock, probing its mysteries with the
        light from his wand.

<b>                                DUMBLEDORE
</b>                  This is the place. Oh yes, this
                  place has known magic.
                       (closing his eyes)
                  Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle
                  once stood many, many years ago,
                  when he was but a poor orphan boy
                  with a penchant for cruelty...
        Dumbledore's wand stops briefly in its arc and his face
        registers pain, as if detecting some past unpleasantry.
        He begins to TRACE HIS FINGERS over the surface of the
        rock.

<b>                                DUMBLEDORE
</b>                  One wintry afternoon, he lured two
                  younger classmates to this cave.
                  What happened is unclear. But
                  this much is known: the children
                  were damaged.

        Dumbledore begins to MURMUR in a STRANGE WHISPER as his
        fingers play over the rock... then stop. His eyes open.
        He takes a dagger from his robes and draws the blade
        across his forearm, speckling the rock face with scarlet
        beads.
<b>                                HARRY
</b>                  Sir!
        The rock face SIZZLES like acid and begins to crumble,
        forming a narrow opening.

        Harry follows Dumbledore around the rim of the lake.     In
        the center, a GREENISH GLOW shimmers in the mist.

<b>                                DUMBLEDORE

        his wand.

<b>                                   HARRY
</b>                  Accio Horcrux!
        There is an EXPLOSION and something PALE erupts out of
        the water. Harry nearly sheds his skin. Dumbledore
        calmly watches it VANISH beneath the surface.

        Dumbledore leads Harry on. Stops. Takes a step back.
        He CLOSES HIS EYES and to Harry's horror walks right to
        the lake's edge. As the dark water laps over the toes of
        his shoes, Dumbledore PASSES HIS HAND slowly through the
        air, then closes it... as if gripping something
        invisible. Taking his wand, he gives his CLENCHED FIST a
        TAP and a thick coppery-green CHAIN appears out of thin
        air, extending from the water to Dumbledore's hand.

<b>                                DUMBLEDORE

        and Dumbledore pull, end over end, until the PROW of a
        SMALL BOAT pierces the surface, green with algae.

        beneath the surface.

        Harry nods, steps out carefully and joins Dumbledore at
        the source of the GLOW -- a BASIN filled with a
        PHOSPHORESCENT LIQUID. Dumbledore extends the tips of
        his blackened fingers toward the basin, but cannot touch
        the liquid.

<b>                                HARRY

        drops the goblet. Harry reaches out, steadies his hand.

        Harry eyes Dumbledore's anguished face, steels himself.

</b>        Harry staggers back, so primal is Dumbledore's plea.
        Dumbledore's arm goes slack, the goblet clanging dully
        against the side of the basin. Harry takes a breath,
        steps forward, places his hand over Dumbledore's, lifts
        the cup.

        Dumbledore's lips.

</b>                  My fault.    It's all my fault...

        Harry brings the goblet up once more.      Dumbledore drinks.

        tips the liquid down his throat. Pain ripples through
        Dumbledore's face. He tries to speak, Harry eyeing him
        with trepidation, fearful of what he will request. Again
        and again Dumbledore struggles and then... his eyes...

        A shudder of relief goes through Harry. Grinning, he
        leaps to the basin. A GOLDEN LOCKET now lies at the
        bottom. Harry snatches it up.

<b>                                 DUMBLEDORE

</b>                  Water!
        Harry dips the goblet into the basin yet again, brings it
        to Dumbledore's lips... but once again finds it empty.
        Dumbledore tries to speak, but his lips are CRACKING, his
        tongue like SAND. He GULPS DRILY for air.

</b>                  I'm trying, sir. I'm --

        Harry stops. All is silent... except for the SOFT
        LAPPING of the lake. He considers the GHOSTLY SHAPES
        gliding just below the surface. Deciding, he dips the
        goblet into the dark water. Instantly, the lake begins
        to CHURN. Harry backs away, the goblet sloshing in his
        hand. FACES, pale and haunted, quiver in the roiling
        water.

        Harry tips the water into Dumbledore's mouth. Dumbledore
        blinks. His tongue probes his lower lip. Harry returns
        to the water's edge, hesitates, then plunges the goblet
        into water once more. Instantly, a SLIMY WHITE HAND
        snags his wrist and Harry is pulled under. The goblet
        bobs on the surface.

        Utterly silent. Harry twists madly as HANDS reach for
        him, turning him this way and that. HAUNTED FACES float
        by.


<b>        NEW ANGLE - THE SURFACE
</b>
        Harry breaks the surface, GASPING for air, blinking,
        catching a glimpse of Dumbledore slumped against the
        basin as he is...


<b>        NEW ANGLE - UNDERWATER
</b>
        ... pulled underwater once again, into the eerie SILENCE
        of flailing arms. He shakes free again and again, but
        there are too many hands, too many haunted faces. We
        STAY UNDER a very long time, feel his lungs burning. His
        eyes lose their focus, turning blank. Bubbles trail out
        of his mouth as his face goes slack. He sinks deeper, in
        free fall, takes one last look at the SHIMMERING SURFACE
        ABOVE, the last thing he will see... when a SHADOW
        SHIVERS briefly and...

        ... the SURFACE SIZZLES with RED LIGHT, like blood, then
        becomes TRANSPARENT, revealing DUMBLEDORE, wand pointed
        directly at the water.


<b>        NEW ANGLE - THE SURFACE
</b>
        Harry breaks the surface, SPITTING UP WATER, GASPING FOR
        AIR. Dumbledore staggers, slumps once more against the
        basin, weakened by his effort. Harry scrambles up,
        steadies him and the lake EXPLODES WITH FIRE. Harry
        wheels, watches the bodies in the lake twist in pain.

        darkening the wood, but do not destroy it. He nods.

        Harry and Dumbledore emerge from the cave. Dumbledore,
        pale and weak, scans the stars wearily, leans heavily on
        Harry.

<b>                                HARRY

<b>125     INT. GREAT HALL - SAME TIME - NIGHT                        125

        We HOLD ON the Gothic glass of the main window. Ambient
        light, ominous and cool, plays across its shimmering
        surface. Flitwick, arms flowing gracefully, conducts a
        group of FIFTH YEARS, looks up toward the window, eyes
        the pulsating light.

        McGonagall stands in the courtyard as the CHOIR DRIFTS
        FAINTLY on the night air. She glances up to the sky, a
        curious expression on her face, then spies a pair of
        First Years straggling across the courtyard.

                                PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                  To your Houses. No dawdling.

        As they scuttle off, McGonagall looks back to the sky.   A
        VORTEX of CLOUDS swirls eerily in on itself. We PULL

        beyond.

        Draco's face, skin glimmering with the light crawling
        across the ceiling above him. He stares, unblinking,
        swings out of the bed. Bare feet -- Draco's -- drop to
        the tiles.


<b>130     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)                         130
</b>        The choir echoes eerily. SIXTH YEARS, little more than
        SHADOWS, hang out, giggling in dark corners. Malfoy
        glides by in his bare feet. Unnoticed. A ghost.


<b>131     INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)              131

        Dense with shadow. Strange slashes of light. Malfoy, a
        shadow within shadows, pulls the tapestry from the
        Vanishing Cabinet, steps back...

        He stares at the monolith before him, lifts his wand and
        begins to CHANT eerily. The surface of the cabinet
        glimmers, atremble in the ambient light. Almost alive.
        Then he stops. Looking back, his eyes haunted, he slips
        away.

        Light plays within the cabinet. Movement. Shadows
        flicker within, coalesce. We ease up, reveal...
        Bellatrix. Greyback.    And a few friends. Bellatrix
        steps into the light.   Glances around. Grins.

        leaning against the ramparts. He dashes to the stairwell
        door and, glancing back, sees Dumbledore MUTTERING
        WEARILY as he GESTICULATES with his blackened hand.

                  No, Harry. I do not pray. I was
                  merely closing a window -- the one
                  that had allowed us to Apparate.

        Harry nods, begins to open the door, when FOOTSTEPS
        sound. Draws his wand. Dumbledore cocks his head,
        listening. Wincing, he straightens up, as if to mask his
        infirmity.

        Harry looks down, through the LATTICEWORK at his feet, to
        the tier below. The FOOTSTEPS DRAW CLOSER.

<b>                                DUMBLEDORE

                  cannot help but question if your
                  heart has been really in them.
                  I'm curious. When Voldemort gave

        actions. Dumbledore eyes the wand, then Draco.

        the gathering clouds, twisting darkly, then glances to
        the stairwell. Dumbledore notices.

                  this time.

        Draco looks deep into Dumbledore's eyes. His hand
        trembles. Transfixed, Harry watches from the shadows.
        Slowly, Malfoy begins to LOWER HIS WAND... when FOOTSTEPS
        ECHO. The DOOR FLIES OPEN: Bellatrix, Greyback and the
        others.

                   done, Draco.

        Harry peers up, eyes flashing angrily at the sound of
        Bellatrix's voice. He draws his wand slowly.

<b>                                DUMBLEDORE
</b>                  Good evening, Bellatrix. I think

                       (to Malfoy)
                  Do it.
        Malfoy's wand rises once again. Harry raises his own,
        aiming through the grid, poised. Just then, a SHADOW
        splinters through the columns to his right. He looks,
        finds Snape, quiet as a ghost, peering upward.
        Carefully, Snape draws his wand, then turns to Harry, a
        finger to his lips: Shhh. Then he is drifting upward.
        Silent. A ghost again.

<b>                                 GREYBACK

                  boy's to do it. Go on, Draco.
                  Now!
        Once again Draco raises his wand, his hand trembling.
        Harry's own arm is stiff, sure. The vein in his hand
        pulsates...

         Harry's eyes dart back and forth frantically, trying to
         make sense of the scene playing out above. Snape's arm
         rises.

<b>                                    SNAPE
</b>                   Avada Kedavra!
         A JET of GREEN LIGHT hits Dumbledore squarely in the
         chest. For a second he hangs, suspended upon the
         ramparts, and then... the night swallows him.

         HARRY SCREAMS in RAGE. Bellatrix raises her wand to the
         sky and a DEAFENING BLAST shakes the castle, masking
         Harry's cry. The CLOUDS EXPLODE with GRIM LIGHT,
         mutating into a SKULL. As the Death Eaters flee, Snape's
         arm drops limply to his side.

<b>                                 SNAPE
</b>                   You can no longer stay here.

         Draco, stunned, stares at the empty place where
         Dumbledore stood only seconds before. Snape takes him by
         the scruff of the neck, forces him through the door, then
         follows.

         Harry scrambles up the stairs and lurches to the
         ramparts, BATHED IN THE GREEN LIGHT from above. He peers
         down. Agony wrecks Harry's face and he has to steady
         himself. He looks up into the leering skull above. Rage
         fills his eyes.

         STUDENTS in pajamas and robes peer at the emerald sky,
         then turn, stare curiously at their teacher and his
         companions. Snape sweeps past wordlessly. Draco averts
         his eyes. Bellatrix leers at a TINY FIRST YEAR, leans
         close:

          Hearing FOOTSTEPS, an AUROR turns, is BLASTED off his
          feet as Snape and the others appear. Bellatrix lags,
          then steps to the TOWERING DOORS of the Hall, peering
          upward, past the FLOATING CANDLES to the vaulted ceiling,
          solemn as a church. Raising her wand, she sends a FIERY
          BOLT toward the GRAND WINDOW opposite. As it EXPLODES, a
          BLAST of COLD AIR sweeps the room, EXTINGUISHING THE
          CANDLES. Snape turns, looks back. Bellatrix simply
          GRINS, a mad child.

          Filch, on guard, looks up, watches SHARDS OF GLASS spill

          Snape and the others race toward the edge of the grounds.
          Suddenly, Snape pulls up, looks back. Sees Harry
          sprinting toward him. Malfoy, looking edgy, is watching
          Harry too.

        wheels, sees Bellatrix and the others silhouetted against
        the flames. They've set Hagrid's Hut ablaze. Malfoy
        stands paralyzed.

        black against the raging fire. Harry points his wand,
        fires a JET of RED LIGHT. Snape doesn't move, merely
        lets it streak by his head. Harry stops, chest heaving,
        and takes aim again.

        With staggering quickness, Snape's wand whips forth and
        Harry is off his heels and crashing to the earth.

        Harry raises himself up on one knee, points his wand
        when... a JET of RED LIGHT sends him crashing back into
        the grass. Snape wheels, sees Bellatrix standing behind.

        Bellatrix eyes Snape levelly, then turns, trots off.
        Snape glances at Harry, then turns away himself, walking.
        Harry grimaces, pulls himself to his feet and aims one
        last time.

        Malfoy and the others where they wait beyond the flaming
        ruins of Hagrid's Hut. They head for the darkness of the

         Ron, Hermione and Ginny stand with the staff. They turn
         and watch the throng of students part for Harry and
         Hagrid.

         Hagrid stops short, shattered by what he sees. Harry
         pushes on, kneels. Dumbledore's eyes are closed, his
         face peaceful. Harry straightens his half-moon
         spectacles, wipes a trickle of blood from his mouth.
         Runs the back of his hand, gently, over the weathered
         cheek.

         Then he notices something lying beside Dumbledore's ashen
         hand: the locket. He takes it, considers it numbly.
         Then begins to cry, great shudders of grief wracking his
         body. Hermione gives Ginny a nudge and she steps
         forward, drops beside him. At her touch, his head falls
         on her shoulder and she begins to stroke him. Ron looks
         on. Understands all.

         McGonagall lifts a trembling wand to the sky and slowly
         the TIP GLOWS to life. One after another, students and
         staff do the same, lifting their wands in salute. As
         CAMERA RISES, the pinpricks coalesce into one BLAZING
         FIRE. The sky, briefly emerald, turns black once more.
         The Dark Mark vanishes.

        Quiet.   Still.   Empty.   Then:                                    

        The door eases OPEN and Harry enters. For a moment, he              
        simply stands staring. Taking inventory. Spying                     
        something, he crosses to the great desk opposite. Looks             
        down.                                                               

        Dumbledore's wand.                                                  

        Reaching out, Harry takes it in hand. Old, oft-used and             
        bearing the impression of its owner's fingers, it is a              
        strangely beautiful object. Harry traces his thumb                  
        lightly over the wood, transfixed, when...                          

        ... McGonagall enters.                                              
                                   PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

        He doesn't respond, lost in the wand. McGonagall's eyes             
        drift to it, briefly, then study Harry's face. She                  
        frowns, trying to call forth some words.                            

                                 PROFESSOR McGONAGALL                       
                   Potter, in light of what's                               
                   happened... should you feel the                          
                   need to talk to someone...                               

        She falters. Harry gently sets the wand back upon the               
        desk, retraces his steps to the door, pauses for one last           
        look.

                   You should know... Professor                             
                   Dumbledore...                                            

        Harry turns then, studying her drawn face, no words                 
        necessary. At a loss, she finishes quietly:                         

                                 PROFESSOR McGONAGALL                       
                   You meant a great deal to him.                           

        Harry's eyes rise. High upon the wall, the past                     
        Headmasters snooze in their frames. The last looks                  
        remarkably peaceful, the trace of a smile on his lips as            
        he sleeps.

         Harry stands at the window, alone in the empty dormitory.
         At the doorway, he looks back. As if committing it to

         Ginny stand further along, just out of earshot. Harry              
         stares into the distance at the ashes of Hagrid's Hut.
         Hermione toys with the locket before them.

</b>                  Yes, but I'm exceptionally                            
                  perceptive.                                           
<b>                                HARRY                                   
</b>                  You're brilliant. You both are.                       

        Harry looks off again and Hermione follows his gaze. She        
        looks out over the grounds. Slowly losing herself. We           
        can tell. She's taking inventory. Pressing it into a            
        scrapbook.

</b>                  Do you think we'll ever... (come                      
                  back?)                                                

        She stops. Her eyes glisten briefly. Then she fights it         
        back. Tough. Harry fights back his own emotion, reaches         
        over and gives her hand a brief squeeze. Then releases          
        her.

</b>                  I don't know.                                        

        Hermione nods and Harry's eyes shift, consider Ron and         
        Ginny. As if sensing his gaze, Ron turns and they              
        exchange a look, something unspoken but true passing           
        between them.                                                  

        Just then a SONG rises on the air, mournful and haunting,      
        and seconds later a BIRD soars out from beyond the             
        tallest turret and begins to stitch its way across the         
        sky.                                                           

        Ron and Ginny cross to Harry and Hermione, lean against        
        the rampart. All look to the horizon, watching the bird        
        grow smaller while its song -- magically -- endures.           
        No one says a word.
