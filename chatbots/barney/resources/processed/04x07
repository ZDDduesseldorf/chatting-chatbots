Ted's friends are in McClaren's.
Barney: I'm not impressed by the talent here tonight. And more I drink, the less it is attractive. I'm a whiskey and Coke in the Cantina scene in Star Wars.
Ted: And those girls over there? They are cannon.
Barney: Absolutely not.
Lily: Are you kidding? I have hated as soon as I saw them. So they are cannon. In fact, I've hated almost as much as Robin when I've ever known.
Robin: You hate me?
Lily: A max.
Marshall: Barney, they are canon.
Barney: There is so much to learn. You are only victims of...the effect cheerleaders. Good question. The effect cheerleading is when a group of women air cannon, but only in groups. As with the cheerleaders. They look like cannon, but take them individually? Cod.
Ted: Anything.
Barney: Look at it carefully. Individually.
Marshall: I know. The last one is kinda cute.
Lily: Yeah, really cute.
Barney: And this, my friends, is "the effect cheerleaders." Also known as the paradox of a bridesmaid syndrome sorority, and for a brief moment in the 90s, the conspiracy of the Spice Girls.Scary Spice, indeed.  Barney Stinson. OK.Understood. Great, we remember.
Ted: What?
Barney: Apparently, I'll be a father.
GENERIC
Ted: You're gonna be a father? How will it happen?
Barney: It's a girl I plugged in a few weeks ago. It is not certain.She sees the doctor tomorrow.
Lily: That may be a false alarm. It is perhaps not pregnant.
Barney: No part of Barney Stinson does not run at less than 110%. If one of my Michael Phelps escaped, he swims for gold. It's a nightmare. I want no children. How can want to have children without being mad?
Barney leaves the bar.
Ted : When you're 30 and you're a couple, something weird happens.
Flashback
Lily and Marshall are sitting on the steps at the entrance of the apartment. Several strollers pass and they get excited to see them.
Ted : You start to see babies everywhere.
Then a woman walks with a dog and a child on his stomach, followed by several puppies Marshall: Go.
Ted : Marshall and Lily caught baby fever. And their neighbors did not help.
Marshall and Lily are their neighbors.
Marshall: You have not lost a sock, little guy? This is probably the cutest little thing I've ever seen.
Woman: That's my little plug!
Ted : That night, they had a serious discussion and hands-on children.
Marshall and Lily are in their apartment, sitting on the couch.
Lily: So if you have a baby, you think you can work less?
Marshall: No matter, it will be so cute, I'm going to exhaust the first day.
Lily: And for the money? It has a ton of debt.
Marshall: We count the unpaid bills on her pretty little fingers.Let's make a baby.
Lily: Now?
Ted : There was just one problem.
Robin: Push yourself. I recorded The View. This problem and was unemployed and sleeping on the couch.
Marshall: So, Robin, when you're in for the job and apartment?
Robin: Are not you aware? I am a presenter on CNN. And I have made gold a terrace overlooking Central Park. Get out of your ass's head, Marshall.
Ted : They realized that if they wanted to start a family, they had the plan.
End flashback
Lily: Robin, would you mind not sleeping with Ted tomorrow night? I... prepares a special dinner for Marshall.
Marshall: Just a dinner. That's it. Nothing else.
Robin: Okay, but you better not be as they stuck together when I cans on the roof. "My ears. The neighbors called the cops.You almost hit me. "
Marshall: Enjoy it. It is a good time.
Barney is in a church, and pray.
Barney: God? It's me, Barney. Are you okay? I know we will not speak often, a bunch of girls said your name on my account. Great. But, God... If you could get out of there, I swear I'll never, never... never, never, never...  Wait, man. Barney to the device.Really?
He leaves the church happy and dancing.
It happens in Marshall's office.
Barney: Good news! I'm not a father!
Marshall: Congratulations, buddy.
Barney: This is the best time of my life, Marshall. What I feel in having no children? I have never thought something like it as much. That's why I created a public holiday. Now, today is "Day of Non-fathers."
Marshall: You create a holiday?
Barney: Why not? Everyone has one: mothers, fathers, soldiers. Why not a day for singles who like it?
Marshall: It looks like a big day of Valentine's Day.
Man: Hello, Stinson.
Barney: Hi. How are the children?
Man: Ready for tonight, Eriksen? Big merger.
Marshall: That's between me and my wife, sir.
Man: The meeting with Mr. Li Tonight.
Marshall: I thought it was a lunch.
Man: Yes, in China. This is a teleconference with the Chinese.I count on you.
Lily is making dinner when the phone rings.
Lily: Marshall?
Marshall: Baby. It's lunchtime in China.
Lily: Yeah.
Marshall: It's not a euphemism. Listen... Wait, what does that mean?
Lily: I know, hot bread, spicy pork? Stuff like that. You come not tonight, right? You shake your head for "no"? That's what I thought.
Ted and Robin arrive at the apartment Marshall and Lily.
Lily: Thank you for coming so quickly.
Robin: Are you okay? You looked upset on the phone.
Lily: Marshall and I, we took the decision to have a great...dinner. And I thought I was ready for a... dinner. But he called to cancel, and it got me thinking. Is it too early for us to make a... Dinner?
Ted: I had lunch early, so I can eat.
Lily: Dinner, it's a baby!
Robin: Lily, it's horrible!
Lily: No, I need you to clarify a situation for me.
Robin: What?
Lily: Are we ready, Marshall and me to have a baby? So, are we ready to have a baby or not?
Ted: We can not decide for you. It's huge.
Robin: You know what is huge? Marshall's head. It is as big as a watermelon in late August. Marshall's baby who is passing by?
Ted: He thinks what?
Robin: A lot of things in the helmet of the space of 50 years who serves as its head.
Lily: Marshall is really excited. But I think he sees only the good sides of it.
Flashback
Lily and Marshall are with their neighbor.
Lily: The other day while playing with the little Jeremy, I was talking with his mother.
Woman: Thank you for the invitation. It's been a while since I have not told an adult. Well, except my husband. But "For you to change" and "Make him be silent," it's not really count as conversation. Sorry, I ramble. It's been 7 months that I have not kissed. That's it, I start! Lack of sleep! Wait, I cry there, though?It happens to me often. I will not complain. Here, I feel bad!That's my little plug! I love you so much!
End flashback
Lily: I will be as carbon copy Charlotte. Worse. At least, her husband works at home. Well, he deale of shit, but it is a caring father.
Ted: Marshall is a very good father.
Lily: Marshall is always at work, and I'm afraid to hit all the work if we have one now.
Ted: You panic and you see only bad side.
Robin: I think it's just realistic.
Lily: Well, that's perfect. That's why I called you. Ted, you're for children. Robin, you're against. Councillors, please proceed.
Ted: OK, I know you're afraid of not being ready. But we think ever be. You just take the plunge and it will come naturally.
Robin: Of course for you, it is natural, you're practically already a father.
Lily: You're a father too.
Ted: What are you talking?
Flashback
At the bar...
Robin: Ted, thoughtful. You go out jokes father of super lame.
Ted: A cereal k*ll! A cereal k*ll!

Barney: That's it!
Robin: Shut up!

Barney: Because at the Non-Fathers Day, you have a Thai girl you a blowjob. Tope, puns!
Back to Lily and Marshall...
Lily: It puts you in the mash, then. Your only hope is to be negative.
Ted: I'll tell you why my opponent says it all. Three words: fear of... babies.
Robin: What? You're crazy. This is false.
Ted: Really?

Marshall: Pub with baby talk?
Ted: Pub with baby talk.
End flashback
Ted: But you're not like that. You like children too.
Lily: Yes, I'm lovely, beautiful and brilliant, but it's enough?
Robin: It comes down to one word: "you". Are you ready to put your dreams in the background? Back in college, taught art at the university? You have to concentrate on the project before starting Lily Baby Project. Otherwise, you'll regret it forever.And it would be good neither for you nor for the baby. What is it?

Robin: We had this debate, and this is the sock that makes you make the decision?
Ted: I think you're taking a "chausettogari", eh, Robin?
Robin: Shut up, Dad.
Ted: You, shut up, baby-phobic.
Robin: Babies are scary, OK? With their giant eyes. And seriously, the fontanelle? If there is a self-destruct button, at least, hide it where it will not accidentally press.
Ted: Where is Lily? You have to drink?
Robin: Not a drop.
Ted: I do not either.
Marshall at work...
Men: Meeting in 5 minutes. You better be on top for Mr. Li This haunts my nightmares. Finally, have fun well, small.

Marshall: What?
Lily: Come on, come on. Make me a baby. I'm ready. Hey, look. The types of the other building make me cuckoo. Hello, gentlemen! We will make a baby!

Barney: What are you talking? This is a good group of friends.
