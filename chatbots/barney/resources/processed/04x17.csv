"You know what? Go ahead, laugh.","Why are you wearing this stuff?"
"Several reasons.","You can not even give five."
"Three: My grandfather was Olaf and he died at 107 years. Four: No elastic waistband leaving its mark around my Thanksgiving belly. And five: each night as I sleep, it's the most wonderful and free feeling in the world. I feel... as if I was flying. That's how I'm going to bed at night: happy, light. With a heart full of joy. And you?","I have to stand still to avoid offending my pajama suit.But at least I do not wear a dress."
"I can not believe it. I need another drink.","I feel a little breeze there. It's nice."

"Yeah, marriage, man, unconditional love. You can wear what you want and you get laid.","Tell me about marriage."
"Sometimes when you're married, the smell of breakfast wakes you ready.","The coffee too?"
"The cafe also. Sometimes she even puts a vase of fresh flowers.","I love flowers. And sometimes when you're afraid of making wrong choices and you're not the one you wanted to be, what it does?"
