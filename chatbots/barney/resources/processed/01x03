 What's wrong with MacLaren's?--- 
 I had no idea why I hung out with Barney.--- You didn't phone-five did you? I know when you don't phone-five, Ted. Come on, we always go to MacLaren's.
 Yeah, cause MacLaren's is fun...--- MacLaren's is this much fun. What I'm offering is the chance to have this much fun.
 See, you say that. You say it's going to be this much fun. But most of the time it ends up being this much fun. This much fun is good! It's safe. It's guaranteed!--- This hand gesture thing doesn't really work on the phone, does it?
 No it doesn't.--- Get in the cab. Marshall you too.
 Oh, I wish I could... I think Lily and I are just goi...--- I understand.  Get in the cab.
 Why can Marshall say no?--- Uhh... because he's getting laid.
 Consistently.--- .
 It's not a rut, okay. It's a routine and I like it!--- Ted, what's the first syllable in rutting 
 Alright, so what's this legendary plan.--- First we got to pick someone up at the airport.
 Okay, I'm outta here.--- 
[The Airport - Barney/Ted]--- Just this one little thing and the rest of the night is ours.
 Why do you have those suitcases, and who are we picking up?--- I don't know. Maybe her? Or her.
 Wait so when you said you were going to "pick someone up at the airport". You meant you were going to "pick someone up at the airport".---  Scenario. Couple of girls fly into town, looking for a fun weekend in NYC when they meet two handsome international business men just back from a lucrative trip to Japan. Sample dialogue, "You have a wheelie bag? Wh... I have a wheelie bag!"
 You've gotta be kidding me.--- False. Sidebar, tuck in your shirt. You look sketchy.
 I'm sketchy?--- Trust me, it's going to be legendary.
[Flashback - Ted answering the door to Barney]--- We're building an igloo in Central Park. It's gonna be legendary. Snow suit up!
[Flashback ends]--- Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here! This is happening. Now you can either put your bags on the carousel now, or you can listen to me give you a really long speech convincing you to put the bags on the carousel. Your move. 
 --- Philly!
 Alright, um, I think we need to refine our back-story first. How did we...--- Ted, you klutzy, great guy, you! 
 Philadelphia.--- Philly? That's where we're headed!
 You are? Well...uh...guess we'll see you on the plane.--- Yes, you will.  Follow them, tickets on me.
  That is awesome.--- Hey, is that Marshall?  Marshall, stop whatever you're doing, get in that hoopty-ass Vierro of yours and come meet us in Philly. It's going to be legendary.
  Man, I wish I could, guys, but...--- Yeah, yeah, yeah... I sent you some pictures on my phone, check it.  Admit it, you're having fun. This much fun. Thirty-five thousand feet of fun!
 Well I didn't think we'd be on a flying to Philadelphia when I woke up this morning, I'll give you that.--- Let's go talk to those girls.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, the seatbelt light is on.--- Ted, you've been living your whole life in a seatbelt. It's time to unclick. 
  Sir, seatbelt light's on.---  Yeah, sorry, sorry.
 Barney, I am going to k*ll you.--- Don't say you're going to k*ll someone in front of airport security, not cool.  Not cool.
[Officer McNeil's Office - A cop/Officer McNeil/Ted/Barney]--- This is an outrage. We are international businessmen on an international business trip. I demand you release us immediately.
 We got footage of you placing two bags on JFK carousel three, and abandoning them to purchase a last minute flight with cash.---  Those bags were your responsibility.
 Look, this is all just... it's a misunderstanding.---  We are international businessmen. My colleague accidentally left the bags there now please let us go before we miss our international business meeting.
 Can't remember the last time I saw an international business man with an untucked shirt. In addition, we received this footage taken over the last few months.--- Believe it or not, that duff bag thing worked.
 Yes, he's that lame. Tell them you're that lame!--- We are international businessmen...
 Sir! Lower your voice or we'll restrain you.--- Dude, seriously, relax.
 We at least get to call our lawyer.--- Exactly!  We have a lawyer?
 You had to play the race card.--- Relax, Ted. We didn't do anything wrong. And, B.T.W, we'd be out of here by now if you'd have tucked in your shirt. 
  No, we can't just... we're going home!---  We're going to Sascha's?
 Who the hell is Sascha?--- Sascha.  She's having friends over for drinks at her house. It's goanna be legen... wait for it...and I hope you're not lactose intolerant 'cuz the second half of that word is... dairy.
 No.--- Legendary!
  Hello.---  Marshall, we're going to Sascha's!
 No, we're not.---  Yes, we are.
[Sascha's house - Sascha/Sascha friend's/Ted/Barney]--- So, uh... you're Sascha's friends, huh?
 Shh!---  Philly!
[Sascha's house - Sascha/Saschas's friends/Ted/Barney]---  Did you hear that, Ted? Dana works security at the Liberty Bell.
  I do okay.--- Wow it must be really well cornered off over there. You ever go behind the rope and touch it?
 Only all the time.--- Ever, like, stick your head inside it?
 Yeah.--- D'you ever lick it?
 Nope, I have never licked it.--- Hmm... I bet nobody in history has ever licked the Liberty Bell! If someone were to pull that off I dare say it would be... what's the word?
  Well, this is my stop.--- Legendary, Ted, LEGENDARY!
[Taxi ride to Airport - Ted/Barney]--- Could have licked the Liberty Bell.
 We're going to the airport.--- Bong, bong...
 Why do I hang out with you? Why? All I wanted was to have a regular beer, in a regular bar with my regular friends, in my regular city!--- Ted, Ted... you're not even looking.
 No, I'm not.--- Look, our forefathers died for the pursuit of happiness, okay. Not for the sit around and wait of happiness. Now if you want, you can go to the same bar, drink the same beer talk to the same people everyday, or you can lick the Liberty Bell! You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it!
 That was beautiful, man!--- Thanks, Leonard. Ted, you're missing out on a valuable life lesson!
 Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okay. I know how to live. If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell just go lick it yourself.--- No, it has to be the two of us.
 Why? Why do you need me?--- Because, you're my best friend, alright? You don't have to tell me I'm yours. But the way I see it, we're a team. Without you, I'm just the dynamic uno. You know what, fine. If you wanna go home... then we'll go home.
 Fine...we'll go lick the Liberty Bell!--- Good,
