"Barney comes dressed in a odd.","Well, I must go to Stella. Tonight is the big night. I tried before, I always failed. This time I will succeed. Tonight... I am a lesbian. Robin, your lipstick."
"Oh, no! Take pictures, okay?","Hi, Ted."
"Theodore!","T-Diddy! You've missed that!"
"Why?","First, I no longer have my gold medallions. I sold them when they are out of date, 400 years ago."
"It's pathetic. It's Saturday night. We should get drunk in a bar. I know this sounds depressing, almost tragic, but it is a fact.","Yeah, and I want another drink for this girl, Doris. I know I can ask this aircraft lesbian."
"With the next train, you can be in McClaren's to 23h.","You can be at 22h."
"That's great! We have darts. A half ping-pong. An aquarium. Look how it's getting a great night as planned. One could make the bait and watch them fight.","No thank you. I play not with aquariums unless they are my two favorite animals: the pilot fish and torturlute. Did you see!"
"For torturlute? You're right.","Marshall."
"You deserve better than that.","Lily."
"Not good enough.","Stella."
"Sorry.","I fall not rest until we not make me respect for another person's knuckles brushing against mine so sweet, but manly.Small, small... Small, small... Small... Who's the baby? Know that as long as it does not have what he wants. No, deserves.This fist will not waver. It... bow... not."
"Me too. My God, I moved to New Jersey?","Guys, I'm sure the dog had to soaring after swallowing the tablet X. Too good! Go!"
"It's not so bad. You can put a mini fridge, there, and perhaps an air hockey.","Air Hockey. Well done my fat."
"I understand why they want to live in New Jersey when you can live in Manhattan? I thought my apartment was one of his reasons for marrying me.","Seriously, I thought it was the only one. Too much!(Robin arrives in the basement) You're glowing. Tape the Barnacle."
"It was not my first day. I arrived and there were 20 people. In fact, I have not really got the job. I just had an interview.","How so?"
"Thank you.","Naughty."
"That sucks, but I can do what? I will not have another job. You would have seen other women in the interview. They were all more experienced, more ""ethnic"". There was a black girl with blue eyes. How can I compete?","You can not."
"I called Joel.","If you call now, you'll regret it. I slept with me full of women who were then sent to graze and then decamped. And sometimes they take the phone and they call me and do it again. And when we finished, I see that look on their faces, that look that says they hate themselves and they would never have known. But if you could see this look... In fact, you can see that look, there is a video, http://www..."
"not Drink Beer! I remember when I bought it. That was before she became pregnant with Lucy. You can go pick on PriceCo? While you will be there, get yourself a map. You surely will go there all the time.","This is the look."
"Stella...","I'll give you $ 100 for hitting my fist. $ 200."
"Drop it, Barney. Your arm should make you suffer.","$ 10 000."
"It's the tears?","They are magnificent... manly tears of pain. They are not emotional. They are a little emotional."
"Shirley, this is Robin. I called Joel.","Robin, hangs up. Do not do that."
"You can never be in town in 30 minutes.","Do not do it. It's scary to bet on itself, if you do not, nobody will. I'm not saying that to pat my fist. Even if a punch would be great. I mean it."
"Ok, this is crazy. You can not believe that New Jersey is better than New York. In New York, there was Broadway. No need to say more.","Oh, yes. Tape for safety."
"It was Atlantic City.","You can not b*at A.C. Pity! Nobody needs to know."
"New Jersey coast.","Chronicles of the Oscar-winning on urban neurotic.Tape!"
"Yes, except I hate it. I'm too big for New York! I try to hold seats in the cramped subway or stoop under doors over 150 years. People are taller, have larger doors. What is your problem?","Small town, big men, then tope."
"Stella back.","Silence embarrassed. Tope then."
"Oh, thank you! Wait. Good evening, New York.","Look, it did."
"It really stops.","You think you're there for something?"
"I think so. Good job, Barney.","Oh, my God! Thank you! Oh, I k*ll my arm. My arm has never been so sore since I was 13 the day I knew how to close the bathroom. Cool!"
