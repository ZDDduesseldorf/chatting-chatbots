Right, so back in 2005 when I was twenty-seven, my two best friends got engaged. And it got me thinking, "Maybe I should get married." Then I saw... Robin. She was incredible. I just knew I had to meet her. That's where your Uncle Barney came in.---I suggest we play a little game I like to call, "Have you Met Ted?"
No, no, no-we're not playing "Have you Met Ted!"---
I'm in love with her.---No! As your sponsor I will not let you relapse. You blew it; it's over-move on.
We are now-Casual---Yeah, cuz nothing says "Casual" like inviting a hundred people over just to "Mac" on one girl. Oh, and Lily-that's my leg.
Get her up to the roof and the roof takes care of the rest.---What's so special about the roof?
We do it up there sometimes.---Solid plan, my little friend.
We're the same height.---But may I suggest one little modification.
That's not the plan.---Should be the plan, I mean look at her. Ted, look at her. She's smokin'!
Barney, I don't wanna say----Aargh! Scoping, beep, scoping, beep!
Man you're a dork.---beep, beep, beep, beep. Target acquired! And now it's time we play a little game I like to call "Have You Met Ted?"
No, come on not this.---Hi! Have you met Ted?
Hi.---Do you know Marshall? Lily?
No.---On a silver platter! Bon appetite!
I work with Carlos.---Excuse me, Anyone know a Carlos?
I don't think so.---Your loss, her gain. Excuse me, can I show you the roof? It's magical up there!
Whoa-whoa-Hey hey. I got that roof reserved!---Dude, Robin's not coming.
cene Five---Oh, you were so right about the roof. The roof. The roof is on fire, Ted! Girl from last night, took her back to my place then this morning took her outside, spun her around a couple of times sent her walking-she will never find her way back and there she is. How did she get here? Did you invite her?
I have no idea who that is.---She said she works with Carlos, who's Carlos?
I don't know any Carlos.---Grr. Hi, you. You're back.
I sure am. Come on, sweetie, I need a drink.---"sweetie"? Really? Sweetie?
Alright.---So, it's over between me-and-works with Carlos girl.
Oh, that was fast.---Yeah, I was trying to think what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met?
So I threw a third party for Robin. On a Sunday night---Oh, this is lame.
lame or "Casual"?---lame.
Hello, Barney.---Of course.
You look well. Isn't it weird they invited both of us?---Who? Who invited you? No one even know who you are!
I understand you're hurt, but, you don't have to be cruel. Carlos was right about you.---Who is Carlos!?
She's not just "one of them" she's the one.---Yeah well, "the one" is heading up to "the roof".
You jealous?---Oh, please, what does Carlos have that I don't?
Ohh!!---I'm not sure I like her.
