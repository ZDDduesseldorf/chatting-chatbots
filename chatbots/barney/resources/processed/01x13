 Wow, the Peace Corps?--- Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, "Is it?" And usually they say, "yes it is."
 Barney, they are so right. I wish there was something I could do.--- Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that.
 Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...--- Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted.
INT. MASSAGE PARLOR--- This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?
 Barney.--- Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste.
 Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?--- You know I did.
 Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.--- You know I won't.
INT. MACLAREN'S--- And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for sex.
 Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.--- Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night.
 OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.--- Really? Ted: Yeah.
 Really? Ted: Yeah.--- But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing.
 I'm ready to be proven wrong.--- Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial.
 Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial.---  Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.
  Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.---  What kind of shoes...
  What kind of shoes...---  Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing.
 Actually.--- Oh come on.
 Whoa. There she goes.---  Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.
Yeah, they do sound cute. Any idea who...? OK, well thanks anyway. Yeah, you take... Tonight? Well, I'm shipping out pretty early so I won't be able to stay over, but, yeah, sure, I'd love to. OK, I'll talk to you later.--- Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight.
 And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for sex.--- I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.
 Going. Getting.--- Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up!
 Yes! No.--- Oh come on!
 Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.--- Ted, you still with us?
 And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be...--- The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot.
