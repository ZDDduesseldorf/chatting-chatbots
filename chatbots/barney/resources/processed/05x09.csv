"Marshall takes Robin and Ted in his arms.","It was a team effort."
"Yes, and you know why? Because I love you. And I'll show you how. Ted Mosby and Robin Scherbatsky, I bring you... the fourth slap.","Wait. What?"
"Certainly not. Unless you were thinking... ""Baffegiving two: Revenge of the lower"" in this case, yes, that's what I'm saying!","The slaps are not transferable."
"Awesome.","Absolutely not!"
"Me too. She speaks little, but that thing with his father gave him much trouble.","Tell me which of you is going to slap me!"
"What?","I die, I, here. Ted takes a chip, I jump! Robin arranges her hair, I jump! I jump all the time. It's bad for my skin. It gives me wrinkles. Wrinkles!"
"Do not underestimate. You're a rock star of slaps. Your name should be Eric Baffe-PTON.","This is torture. Put me in the chair..."
"The Throne of Baffe.","And finish it!"
"No, not at all.","This is interesting."
"Let me do it. It was my idea to call the objects found in the prefecture.","It's a good point. Rebuttal?"
"I slipped a note of the type 20!","philosophical riddle. Idea against execution. Itemize your arguments."
"You have to let it calm down. Finish the game.","Repeat-a. The first seven!"
"It's decided. Barney, go. Come on the throne.","You're gonna..."
"Yep. Go.","I guess this is the best choice, Robin. Finally... the men are stronger than women."
"Do not listen. It's decided.","And that's what you always wanted, is not it? A strong man to take care of you? Of course, teenager, you were a feisty, playing hockey with the boys, you skinned your knees on the ice. But what you could say to your teammates... or even to yourself... that is all you really wanted was this pretty white dress in this beautiful white chapel. And at the end of the aisle strewn with pretty white flowers, a man to take care of all your slaps."
"Everyone. Before we begin, Barney, we'll need you on the throne of Baffe.","Commissioner of the bet-Baffe, tie me to the chair is a violation..."
"Thank you.","This is the worst."
"I know.","It's downright hell."
"Robin is about to slap...","It hurts!"
"I do not either.","thank you God."
"So, I want to move. Mickey?","No way!"
"It stretches and then...","Gently!"
"I'm sorry. I can not do it.","thank you God."
"I know I have not been a good father.","You're kidding me."
"So for all dance recitals that I missed, for all the art exhibitions that I should attend... for the wedding that I was not able to offer you... I give you, to you This slap.","No. No, no, no, no. It is the Commissioner of the bet-Baffe. It must remain impartial!"
"The Commissioner of the bet-Baffe says it's good.","It's not good. Please... Let me..."
"It warms the hand and stops.","I'm running in a meadow."
"Because... the slap did exactly what I hoped. It brought us together. And it forced us to recognize the weakness and at the same time the greatness in ourselves and in others.","Stop your bullshit."
"It separates the Barney ""Throne"".","This is the best Thanksgiving..."
