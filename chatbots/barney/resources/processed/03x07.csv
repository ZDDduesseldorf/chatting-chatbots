"Yeah i thought i was gonna get married to my last boyfriend but, boy, did that guy have commitment issues! That whole relationships, that 3 weeks of my life i'll never get back.","Well, I love commitment. I wish i could marry commitment."
"Really?","So perky and full of life and not at all fake."
"You're talking about her boobs, right?","C! And that wasn't spanish, that was cup size! What up!"
"So these boobs...","Mmmm..."
"Paint me a word picture.","All right, Ted. Imagine the heads of two Irish babies. Let's call them...(bbllluuuuu) and"
"Well, clearly i wasn't!","Pay up! p*ssy!"
"Oh, they're on vacation in France for 2 weeks.","I see. Between you and me, i'm also interested in this apartment. So is there any way i could come back later and check it out while you'rte showing them other places?"
"Are you serious? You're trying to sneak this apartment away from Marshall and Lily?","Ted, do you think i have no morals whatsoever? I simply want to fool a girl into thinking this is my apartment so i can nail her once and never have to see her again. I'm not a monster!"
"This place is so nice.","Ah, make yourself at home. Please get comfortable. If you see something you like, just take it."
"Who are these people?","Uh... That's my parents."
"They're Asian.","Yeah! They're a chinese couple that wanted a white baby, it works both ways. Cookie?"
"Wow! Did you make those?","You got me. My sisters taught me how to bake and how to listen."
"Wow, i feel so at home here.","I'm glad. Sometimes, i don't. A place like this really needs a lady of the house. I know it's early to be thinking of you as... Oh, God, i'm freaking you out, aren't I? It's just you make me feel so safe. I didn't..."""
"Okay, let me get this straight. You just snuck this girl into some stranger's apartment?","Yeah, we spent the night."
"I'm wearing your bathrobe. I hope you don't mind.","The only thing missing from that bathrobe are your initials."
"My mom's gonna be in town next week. It's okay if she stays with us?","Only if she sleeps in the bed and i sleep on the couch."
"You're so sweet.","I love you. There, i said it and i'm not taking it back."
"Oh my god! I love you too. I'm finally not the first one to say it!","How about you get in the shower, and i will make us some waffles."
"Wait. That time that you offered to walk my dogs when i went to visit my dad in Vancouver...","Yup!"
"Is that why my Yorkie trembled for like a week after i got back?","Yeah. That little guy saw some stuff i'm not proud of."
"Ew, that was on the floor.","If you wwant to get to the bottom of this, you're gonna need a stronger stomach than that, doll face."
"(We see Lily jump on Marshall and kiss him) Which would mean....","What do you think, make obsess?"
"Nice catch, Robin.","I'll just, uh, take this down to the lab.."
"bup bup bup bup bup... Theres's only one possible conclusion. Lily and Marshall are fighting about peanut butter.","Ah!"
"I know what they were fighting about, and it wasn't peanut butter.","Robin, just..."
"I appreciate your help, but there's a reason your name is Robin, not Batman.","Just..."
"They were fighting because they didn't get the loan and it's all Lily's fault.","Robin, just..."
"This can't be happening.","They can't... get divorced."
"Yeah, it is. It's weird.","The world needs Marshall and Lily... together... I'm not crying, there's something in my eye."
"We have an annoucement.","I know, it's a terrible idea. You can't do it. Just look at me."
"Wow, guys! You scared us.","Oh, thank God. Cause, i mean, if you did then who'd be the lame married couple i get to make fun of? Like 'Hey Marshall, you're married mrs right, you just didn't know her first name was Always.' That stuff is cold."
