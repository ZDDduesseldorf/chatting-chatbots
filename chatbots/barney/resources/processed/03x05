 Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore.--- So, she's hot.
 Oh, she's gorgeous.--- Then she's crazy.
 No she's not.--- Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes.
 OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me.--- There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale.
 Wait, hot-crazy scale?--- Let me illustrate.
 Let me illustrate.--- A girl is allowed to be crazy...
 A girl is allowed to be crazy...---... as long as she is equally hot.
... as long as she is equally hot.--- Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.
 Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.--- If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.
 If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.--- You want the girl to be above this line
 You want the girl to be above this line--- Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head...
 Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head...---...then lose ten pounds.
...then lose ten pounds.--- She'd stab me with a fork...
 She'd stab me with a fork...---... then get a boob job.
... then get a boob job.--- I should give her a call.
 OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class.--- I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts...
 She's not crazy.--- OK, we'll see.
 Long story short, thank goodness I'm such a bad cook or I never would have met Ted.--- It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy.
 No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No.--- Really? Sixteen no's. Really?
 Oh, I get it. Ted told you I didn't go to college so now you're giving me a cute little backhanded slap.--- Oh, here we go.
 Well, while you were busy majoring in being freaking beautiful, I was starting my own line of handbags.--- Your own line of handbags? That's crazy.
 You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please.--- OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it.
 OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it.--- Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died.
 Oh, I'm sorry about that.--- No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh.
 Oh man, I'm really sorry.--- Wow, you bought that?
 Ted.--- Are you a total idiot, Ted?
 Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney:  Well played.--- I like you Ted.
 I like you Ted.--- Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.
 Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.--- Barney. We met at the urinal.
 Oh right, hi.--- Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit.
 I'm not wearing a suit.--- Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.
 Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.--- Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes.
 Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes.--- Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward.
 Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward.---  Edward, this is Audrey.
  Hi, my name is Audrey. Nice to meet you--- He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.
  I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.--- What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.
 Here. Call me.--- And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever.
  He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.--- Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online.
 OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.--- Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?
;--- Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.
 Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.--- She started the night here
 She started the night here--- But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.
 But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.--- Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to k*ll me with a brick.
 No, no no no no no no no no no no no.--- How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times.
 How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times.--- It was right over there.
 It was right over there.--- Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you.
 This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass.--- I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.
 You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.--- No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference.
 I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend.--- Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her.
 Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her.--- How much hotter is she than your girlfriend? Marshall: There's no comparison. What do you think, Ted? Go for it? Ted: Oh, don't do it, man. Think about Lily.
 You know what, I don't care. I've been with one woman for too long. I need me some strange.--- Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger.

 Poor guy's gonna crash and burn.--- That man is a god.
 For like a week after, Barney followed me around, asking me to teach him how to live. I even got him to do my laundry once.--- I thought it was a Mr. Miyagi kind of thing.
 And I'm unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.--- Worst superheroes ever.
 Another girl, Ted? Who haven't you made out with? You know what, I don't need this. I design handbags. I'm writing a memoir. I'm a superstar. This is totally my year. Someday the name Blah-blah will be up in lights. Ted, next time you're online playing World of Warcraft, don't even think about chatting with me.--- World of Warcraft? The online role playing game? That's how you two met online?
