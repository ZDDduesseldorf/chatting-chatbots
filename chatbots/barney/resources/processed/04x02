At Ted and Marshall's apartment--- Get this. You know who works out at my gym? Regis Philbin.
 Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank?--- Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Took two months. Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal. Who wants a T-shirt?  Hey, Marshall, they're hiring in the legal department. I could get you a job.
 We had sushi last night.--- Italian.
 Oh.--- I don't like Chinese.
 Indian?--- I just said I don't like Chinese.
 Indian isn't Chinese.--- Weird meats, funny music, side of rice. Why are we splitting hairs?
 Mexican?--- I just said I don't like Chinese.
 It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef k*ll it and ran it through the meat grinder.--- I love this burger so much, I want to sew my ass shut.
The tiniest little burger joint you ever saw, tucked between a taxidermist and a triple-X bookstore.--- Name two places where things get stuffed.
They laugh.--- You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying.
 No.--- No. No, we don't know where it is.
 No. No, we don't know where it is.--- I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!
 I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!--- OK, Regis, we will, we will.
What are you waiting for? Get out and find the burger!--- All right.
 Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat.--- You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment.
 Just shut up and eat.--- All right.
 I think I just had my first burg-asm.--- I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know?
Barney's phone rings. He answers.--- Barney Stinson.
 Barney Stinson.--- I'm sorry, this is...?
 Regis. I'm at the place.--- Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now.
 Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now.--- Onions?
 Onions?--- Okay, no onions.
They discover a Goliath National Bank ATM.--- One of 9,000 convenient locations.
Lily starting to hit Barney with her fits.--- What the...
 I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again. Goliath National Bank sucks. It's the worst bank on the face of the earth. Attention, New Yorkers, this bank sucks! They suck!--- Marshall, Geez.
 They suck, suck!--- Will you just tell her already?
 Goliath National Bank. That's why Barney's been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is. He wanted you to be excited for me since we will to working together.--- Well, technically not together. You won't have access to my floor.
 I haven't worked since March.--- If only there were an easy, convenient way to get some cash right now.
They all turn around face to the Goliath ATM.--- Member FDIC.
 Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me.--- This feels so good. I'm worried I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.
Regis gets up.--- That's outrageous.
