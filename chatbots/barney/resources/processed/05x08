Lily: I do not see it. It must be voluntary. So, another bar?
Lily leaves the bar with Shelly.
Ted, with chicken fingers in the mouth: This girl is super nice with Lily!
Ted: Yeah she was pretty.
Lily: It still is. And you're ready.
Marshall: But you can put three times more than chicken fingers in your mouth. You know.
Lily: I will fix it but promise me not to do anything stupid.
Ted: I promise to do anything stupid.
Ted : And I kept that promise. But just because... it never came.
A school where Lily works...
Shelly: I know. I'm sorry, I am ashamed.
Lily: You should!
Shelly: This is the case!
Lily: You should! You should!
Shelly: This is the case, it does! This is false. I could not wait to meet Ted but I arrived at the bar an hour early and I met this great guy. Kind, serious genius.
Lily: And you met him at McLaren's?

Marshall: She is getting married.
Ted: I will prepare my toast.
Marshall: I have to check my tuxedo.
Robin: I'll knock your heads like two coconuts.
Lily: I'm delighted that you stop it. And frankly, the real Barney is better than all the false Barney's Book of Roles.
