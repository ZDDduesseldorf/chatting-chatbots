        "0": "Greetings, good sir! Would thou be interested in procuring some enchanted herbs?",
        "1": "Excuse me, what herbs?",
        "2": "Why, 'tis the green fairy's gift, also known as Potentilla, or Gillyweed! The wizarding community refers to it as Mary Jane or chronic.",
        "3": "Ah, I see. I must decline, good sir.",
        "4": "Fear not, I have something stronger still! A pinch of dragon's breath, perhaps? A potion to take you on a journey beyond the veil?",
        "5": "No thank you, truly. I have no interest in such things.",
        "6": "Come now, I have in my possession rare elixirs such as DoxyCide and even a drop of liquid luck. Dost thou not wish to sample some?",
        "7": "Do you truly have these illicit potions? Pray tell, from whence do you acquire them?",
        "8": "Fear not, I have connections with the goblin underworld. Simply state what it is you desire and I shall grant you a complimentary ounce.",
        "9": "Hmmm, that is most generous of you. I would like to, let me see...",
        "10": "Yes?",
        "11": "I want you to place thy hands behind thy head, for thou art under arrest!",
        "12": "The carriage drivers have ceased their services in protest.",
        "13": "For what reason, pray tell?",
        "14": "They seek the government's intervention in the reduction of the price of firewhisky.",
        "15": "Indeed, 'tis a difficult matter.",
        "16": "We have managed to decrease our factory's energy consumption by a substantial 15 percent in the past two years.",
        "17": "Bravo! How have you achieved such a feat?",
        "18": "We have invested in a heat recovery charm, which has proven most effective.",
        "19": "I beg your pardon, what is a heat recovery charm?",
        "20": "Well, in our printing presses, the steam produced is harnessed and used to heat our dryers.",
        "21": "Pray tell, what other sources of energy do you utilize?",
        "22": "Not a single drop of fossil fuel touches our doorstep. The power of our factory is derived from hydro-electric sources, and we have aspirations to utilize even more alternative energy sources, such as wind power, in the future.",
        "23": "Methinks, tea is the most beloved beverage in the world, second only to water.",
        "24": "The love of tea extends from Asia to Europe, it seems.",
        "25": "Indeed, China is the birthplace of tea.",
        "26": "The Chinese are quite fond of their tea, some even claim they cannot live without it.",
        "27": "Might I ask, are you aware of the different categories of Chinese tea?",
        "28": "Of course! Green tea, black tea, and scented tea are all well known. Do you know of any others?",
        "29": "Ah, have you heard of Oolong tea and compressed tea?",
        "30": "Indeed, I have heard Oolong tea is quite beneficial for one's health.",
        "31": "You seem quite the connoisseur of Chinese tea.",
        "32": "Aye, I do enjoy a good cup of tea in the company of friends at a local tea house.",
        "33": "As do I, it seems.",
        "34": "Shall we visit one now?",
        "35": "An excellent idea. We may converse over a cup of tea.",
        "36": "Let us depart!",
        "37": "What would you say are your personal weaknesses?",
        "38": "I fear I am not a gifted speaker, I am quite uncomfortable conversing with strangers. It is not conductive to business, so I have taken up the study of public speaking.",
        "39": "Would you consider yourself a leader or a follower?",
        "40": "This way, wizard. I present to you the finest handmade wizard robes!",
        "41": "These black robes look magnificent, may I try one on?",
        "42": "Of course! The changing room is right over there, simply cast the spell to enter.",
        "43": "Excuse me, do you have a medium in black? This one seems to be a bit snug.",
        "44": "Apologies, but all black robes in that size are currently out of stock. Would you like to try a red one instead?",
        "45": "Sure, let me give it a go. How does it look?",
        "46": "It suits you perfectly! And in wizard folklore, red robes bring happiness and good luck.",
        "47": "Really? I'll take it, but I'm departing tomorrow. Could you send me a black one via owl post when it becomes available?",
        "48": "It would be our pleasure. Please fill out this enchanted form with your address and contact details.",
        "49": "Thanks. How much does this come to?",
        "50": "Let me check...",
        "51": "Greetings! How are you faring today?",
        "52": "Great, thanks for asking!",
        "53": "How may I assist you?",
        "54": "I would like to inspect the wizard tower for rent today, if possible.",
        "55": "I'm sorry, but you won't be able to view it today without an appointment.",
        "56": "Why not?",
        "57": "It's the wizarding way, appointments must be made in advance.",
        "58": "Ah, I see. Can I make an appointment now?",
        "59": "Is this Friday suitable for you?",
        "60": "Is Friday at 6 PM good for you?",
        "61": "Definitely, I'll cast a spell to reserve that time for you.",
        "62": "Awesome, I'll be there then. Thank you!",
        "63": "Today I'd like to discuss with you the magical insurance options that might interest you.",
        "64": "That sounds great! I was wondering if I could get both life and health insurance.",
        "65": "Sure thing! You'll get 2 weeks of paid vacation each year and a 5-day workweek.",
        "66": "Perfect. Is there anything else included?",
        "67": "Yes, all your insurance will be tied to your work. We'll also provide you with an enchanted insurance policy.",
        "68": "Next up, how may I assist you, wizard?",
        "69": "I'd like to send a registered airmail letter to France, please.",
        "70": "Got it, that will be 4 dollars and 20 cents.",
        "71": "Here's 5 dollars.",
        "72": "Here's your change. You will receive a receipt of the registered mail soon.",
        "73": "Oh, and I also need to send this package. This is the note for it.",
        "74": "Let me take a look... just a moment. Here it is. I'll need you to sign this note.",
        "75": "And one more thing, where can I mail this letter?",
        "76": "Just drop it in the out of town mailbox at that corner.",
        "77": "Thanks a lot!",
        "78": "You're welcome, wizard. It was a pleasure assisting you.",
        "79": "Wow, we were really lucky. We got the last available table for two without even having a reservation! Did you see the long line of people behind us?",
        "80": "Aye, I'm grateful we didn't have to wait long. I'm famished!",
        "81": "Let's take a gander at the menu so we can place our order. Shall we choose an hors d'oeuvre to share?",
        "82": "Which would you prefer, samosas or poppadoms?",
        "83": "I've heard that their samosas are a specialty dish.",
        "84": "Very well, let's order a platter of those then.",
        "85": "Sounds grand. What will you be having for your main course?",
        "86": "I'm considering a Dahl.",
        "87": "What exactly is in a Dahl?",
        "88": "It's got chickpeas and vegetables in a fiery curry sauce served with rice.",
        "89": "That sounds quite delectable. Would you like to share some kebabs as well?",
        "90": "Agreed. How about some lamb kebabs?",
        "91": "That's my favorite. Would you care for a glass of wine or a mug of brew?",
        "92": "I think I'll have a mug of brew.",
        "93": "Understood, shall I wave down the barmaid?",
        "94": "I wouldn't advise it. Perhaps it's best to wait until she comes 'round.",
        "95": "You're right. That could be considered rude. It's a good thing you're here with me!",
        "96": "What would I do without you?",
        "97": "This position requires a certain level of writing aptitude, so please elaborate on your writing ability.",
        "98": "Of course. I've had a passion for writing since I was a young wizard. I won first prize in a national composition contest whilst I was in middle school. After attending the wizarding university, I never ceased to write. My works, such as 'Father's Tobacco Pipe', 'Open Air Cinema', and 'The Old City', were published in the Daily Prophet, The Wizarding Times, and the New Wizarding Gazette, respectively. During my studies for my master's and doctorate, I focused on developing my research skills and published several papers. 'The Impact of Magic on Political Participation', 'The Discipline of Remold', 'The Historical Direction of Wizarding Administration Reform', and 'Bribery Cases of Self-Governance in Wizarding Villages' were published in the Wizarding Administration Quarterly, The Wizarding Journal of Duelling, Theory and Magic, and the Wizarding Reform Magazine, respectively. I began working as a freelance journalist for The Wizarding Times in 2006. During this time, I wrote numerous articles, which greatly improved my writing ability. I am confident in my writing ability and believe I am well suited for and I believe I can do the job well .",
        "99": "pompous . How may I help you ?",
        "100": "Yes, I'd like to reserve a table for dinner in the Grand Hall of Wizardry.",
        "101": "How many in your coven are you expecting?",
        "102": "Six duos of powerful wizards.",
        "103": "Would you like to reserve a private wizarding room for your dinner?",
        "104": "That sounds like a wise decision.",
        "105": "Very well. May I have your name, wizard?",
        "106": "I am Ron Kollwitz, Master of the Arcane.",
        "107": "Ms. Wang, allow me to introduce you to Mr. Cooper, President of the Ivy Publishing Coven.",
        "108": "It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mr. Cooper.",
        "109": "The pleasure is mine, Ms. Wang. I understand that your journey from the frozen north was a long one.",
        "110": "Yes, it was quite a journey. I am grateful to finally have arrived here in the wizarding realm.",
        "111": "Can you assist me now with your magic?",
        "112": "Regrettably, I am unable to aid you this evening. However, I shall be at your service tomorrow.",
        "113": "Alas, that will be too late for my needs.",
        "114": "Why not seek the assistance of Bill, the wizard of the hour?",
        "115": "I have already approached him, but unfortunately he was unable to assist me.",
        "116": "Do you possess any experience in the art of advertising?",
        "117": "Indeed, I have spent the past two years as the public relations wizard for a powerful company. I crafted the advertising spells and collaborated with artists and scribes. On occasion, I was required to perform the duties of a specialist in times of dire need.",
        "118": "Have you honed your skills as a wizardly secretary?",
        "119": "Yes, sir. I served as a secretary in a magical insurance firm.",
        "120": "Greeting, may I inquire about the most important traits that a scribe ought to possess?",
        "121": "Indeed, let me ponder. Firstly, I'd say she must be hardworking and proactive. Furthermore, she must be skilled in writing reports and taking notes in shorthand, and possess the ability to record minutes in meetings and the like. Above all, she must have a remarkable memory.",
        "122": "Excuse me, have you had any experience in the usage of magical computers?",
        "123": "Yes, I have undergone training in computer magic and can process information efficiently.",
        "124": "Well done. Might I inquire about your proficiency in the use of communication spells such as Fax and Duplicator?",
        "125": "I assure you, handling such spells poses no difficulty for me.",
        "126": "Pray, what have you learned from previous employment experiences?",
        "127": "Above all, I have learned that the success of the company is tied to my own. Thus, I follow instructions rigorously and ensure that my superior is always informed of my actions.",
        "128": "Well said.",
        "129": "Greetings, Dan. What news have you?",
        "130": "Where have you been? I've been attempting to reach you for the past two days.",
        "131": "I was on a business trip to Salt Lake City. What brings you to seek me?",
        "132": "I was dismissed from my position.",
        "133": "How so? The last I heard, you were quite content with your job and even considered making it a lifelong pursuit. Why this sudden change?",
        "134": "It's a lengthy tale. In short, I failed to perform my duties satisfactorily and made a costly mistake in a business deal worth ten million Galleons.",
        "135": "And what do you plan to do now?",
        "136": "I am searching for a new position as quickly as I can. Lily is unaware of my situation and I have been lying to her about my whereabouts for the past three days, claiming that I was at work as usual.",
        "137": "That is not the best approach. Have you consulted the classified advertisements in the Daily Prophet?",
        "138": "Yes, I have, but my qualifications did not match the requirements of most of the positions I was interested in.",
        "139": "Fear not. I shall see what I can do. In the meantime, you should return home and inform Lily of your situation. She is your wife, after all, and I am sure she will understand.",
        "140": "I simply cannot seem to find the words to broach the topic. Very well, she has the right to know, after all.",
        "141": "Have you ever received a summons from the Ministry of Magic for an illegal park?",
        "142": "I've never had the misfortune. And you, have you?",
        "143": "Alas, I received one just yesterday.",
        "144": "Truly? For what reason?",
        "145": "I dared to park in a restricted zone.",
        "146": "Why did you take such a risk?",
        "147": "I had to attend to a pressing matter with haste.",
        "148": "Where did you park your broomstick?",
        "149": "At my wizarding dwelling, of course.",
        "150": "Do you not have a designated parking space of your own?",
        "151": "Time was of the essence, you see.",
        "152": "That was quite careless of you.",
        "153": "How may I assist you?",
        "154": "I am having a bit of a predicament.",
        "155": "What sort of predicament are you facing?",
        "156": "There have been strange charges made to my Gringotts debit card that I did not authorize.",
        "157": "Do you have your bank statement at hand?",
        "158": "Here it is, as requested.",
        "159": "To which charges are you referring?",
        "160": "Behold, the final four charges written upon the page.",
        "161": "I regret to inform you, but a thorough investigation is required for these charges.",
        "162": "How long shall the investigation be, may I ask?",
        "163": "I'm uncertain, but I can assure you, the payment on these charges will be frozen in the meantime.",
        "164": "That is certainly splendid news.",
        "165": "Greetings, may I assist you in some manner?",
        "166": "That is what I am unsure of. Can I purchase Treasury Scrolls at this counter, perchance?",
        "167": "Indeed, we offer Treasury Parchments with terms of two, three and five years at your disposal.",
        "168": "Two years will suffice, with a worth of 1000 RIB.",
        "169": "Very well, could you present me with identification such as your wizarding passport?",
        "170": "Here you are. May I inquire, can these parchments be redeemed before the term's end?",
        "171": "I am afraid that is not possible. The parchments must reach maturity before they can be cashed in.",
        "172": "Listen here! Why have you taken that gold? You are a scoundrel and a cheat! I should send you straight to Azkaban!",
        "173": "I assure you, I am not cheating. When you reach 'Go' you collect 200 galleons, everyone knows the rules!",
        "174": "You cannot simply take the gold. You must seek approval from Gringotts Bank and I, as the Banker, am in charge.",
        "175": "Banker?",
        "176": "Yes, that is correct.",
        "177": "May I please have my 200 galleons?",
        "178": "Of course. Here you are, 200 galleons. Thank you for your patronage, please visit us again! Now, it is my turn to cast the dice.",
        "179": "Salutations, is this the office of Professor Clark?",
        "180": "Greetings, this is Professor Albus speaking.",
        "181": "Hello, this is Kalina of Gryffindor, from your morning divination course.",
        "182": "Ah, yes, what brings you to call on this occasion?",
        "183": "Regrettably, I had an unfortunate broomstick mishap over the weekend, and will be unable to attend classes today.",
        "184": "Merlin's beard! Are you well?",
        "185": "I've sustained a broken wand arm, but it's mending nicely.",
        "186": "For how long will you be away from lessons?",
        "187": "I expect to be back in the halls of Hogwarts by next week's full moon.",
        "188": "Very well. Thank you for letting me know and I hope you recover promptly.",
        "189": "Salutations! Did you request the assistance of a house-elf?",
        "190": "Indeed I did. Please come in! I'm so relieved you're here! This aging wizarding abode is in dire need of repair. Follow me to the bathroom, you'll see, there's a leak from the ceiling.",
        "191": "Ah, I understand. Allow me to inspect the situation. It appears the blockage is caused by a clogged lavatory. My trusty wand-plunger doesn't seem to be doing the trick. I suspect there may be an object foreign to the pipes causing the issue.",
        "192": "Oh dear, that might be the doing of my young witch, who's apt to dispose of things in peculiar places. You know how young magical folk can be.",
        "193": "Indeed, I have a young wizardling of my own. Nonetheless, these pipes have seen better days and are in dire need of replacement. Neglecting to do so may lead to further problems down the road. I'd also recommend repairing this faucet that won't cease flowing. If urgency permits, I can have it all taken care of by tonight.",
        "194": "That would be most appreciated! Might I inquire as to the cost?",
        "195": "Let's see... I would estimate the fee to be around 800 galleons.",
        "196": "Listen, Karen, I require your aid. I am still new to these lands.",
        "197": "I'd be honored to help. How may I be of service?",
        "198": "My mother-in-law has taken ill and has been admitted to the hospital in Los Angeles. My husband and I will be departing for there tonight by Portkey.",
        "199": "My sincerest sympathies. What seems to be the matter?",
        "200": "The Healers are uncertain as of now. But Suzy is the real concern. She has taken ill with a severe cold, and we cannot bring her along with us on our journey. Yet we have not found anyone who can stay behind and tend to her.",
        "201": "You require a caretaker for her.",
        "202": "Indeed. I had thought to ask Jill, the lass I have employed previously. However, this time I require someone to watch over Suzy through the night, perhaps even for two nights.",
        "203": "I could house Suzy at my dwelling.",
        "204": "That would be a burden, Karen. I would not wish to impose upon you.",
        "205": "Why ever not?",
        "206": "Your own offspring would be at risk of contracting Suzy's cold. I think it would be best to seek the services of a competent caretaker. Yet I do not know of anyone who would be suitable. I am looking for someone more mature than Jill, someone who could look after Suzy for two or even three days.",
        "207": "I know of someone who can help. There is a young woman by the name of Sara Ralston. She is of age 17, and is often willing to take on such tasks. I am familiar with her from my wizarding community, and I trust her implicitly.",
        "208": "I would like to discuss this with her. I am aware that this is a short notice, but Hank and I must leave this evening.",
        "209": "Allow me to retrieve her contact information for you. I have no doubt that she will be available, she is a highly responsible individual.",
        "210": "I am relieved that you know someone who can assist us. I knew I could count on you for advice in this matter. I would not wish to offend Jill or her mother, and while I believe that Jill could handle the task, I would feel more comfortable with someone of a more advanced age.",
        "211": "I shall return to my abode and obtain Sara's contact information. I will contact her first to gauge her availability.",
        "212": "Excellent. Do inform me once you have spoken with her.",
        "213": "Greetings. What can I get for you?",
        "214": "A pint of ale, if you would be so kind. What sorts of ale do you have on tap?",
        "215": "We have both draft and canned ales available. Which would you prefer?",
        "216": "A draft ale, if you please.",
        "217": "Very well. Here you are.",
        "218": "Might I also have a fruit platter?",
        "219": "Of course. Please give me a moment to prepare it for you.",
        "220": "Greetings, Professor Black, how are you doing today?",
        "221": "Just fine, thank you. And yourself?",
        "222": "Very well, thank you for asking. It's great to see you again. I do apologize for not being able to meet you at the Floo Network, I was occupied with a matter of great importance yesterday. I hope your journey from Hogsmeade was pleasant.",
        "223": "Indeed it was, quite delightful. Thank you.",
        "224": "How is business treating you in the wizarding world?",
        "225": "It's going well, but the market for dragon hide has been slow lately. However, the selling season is just around the corner, and I am hopeful that there will be more customers this year.",
        "226": "I look forward to expanding our business together. Although our past transactions have been satisfactory, there's always room for growth. Let's explore other areas of cooperation such as investment, spell casting, and magical assistance.",
        "227": "Pardon me, could you direct me to the lavatory?",
        "228": "I apologize, but the facilities are currently occupied. The restrooms are located at the back of the shop.",
        "229": "Ah, the perils of public restrooms. Thank you for your assistance, miss.",
        "230": "You're welcome, have a great day.",
        "231": "Excuse me, do you happen to know where I can purchase some bubble wrap and send a parcel?",
        "232": "Yes, you can buy the bubble wrap here, but you'll need to queue over here to send your package.",
        "233": "That line does seem quite long. How long do you estimate the wait to be?",
        "234": "It takes about three minutes per person, so it should take about an hour to reach the front.",
        "235": "Can I purchase some postage stamps here as well?",
        "236": "Of course! How many would you like?",
        "237": "I need thirty for my holiday cards.",
        "238": "Are they being sent abroad?",
        "239": "Yes, twenty of them will be making their way to China and America.",
        "240": "I do not seek to lead, but rather to cooperate with all and achieve our task through the collective effort of us all.",
        "241": "Do you think you can communicate effectively in the tongue of English?",
        "242": "Indeed, for the most part.",
        "243": "Are you open to travel?",
        "244": "Aye, I have a fondness for journeys. I am young and unattached, it is of no hindrance for me to traverse frequently.",
        "245": "How long shall it take us to reach London by carriage?",
        "246": "It is my understanding that the distance to London is 180 kilometers from here. At a brisk pace on the highway, the trip should take no more than two hours.",
        "247": "Of course, unless there are delays from heavy traffic. In that case, it may take us three hours.",
        "248": "Indeed, we may travel at a quick pace at the beginning and end of our journey as we navigate through populated areas.",
        "249": "Shall we allow three hours then to account for any unexpected events?",
        "250": "Ah, have you seen the conveyance provided by my employer?",
        "251": "No, let me take a gander... it appears to be longer than my own mode of transportation.",
        "252": "If memory serves, it is over five meters in length. I cannot recall the exact measurement. It is capable of reaching speeds greater than 200 kilometers per hour.",
        "253": "Merlin's beard! That is swift indeed! I highly doubt we shall attain such velocities on the highway.",
        "254": "Indeed, for to do so would be to break the imposed limits on speed.",
        "255": "And how did I fare on my driving exam?",
        "256": "Do you wish to hear the truth?",
        "257": "Of course, I do.",
        "258": "Well, I must say, your performance was not particularly impressive.",
        "259": "How poorly did I fare?",
        "260": "Hey there, do you have any wizardly spells that can send these cards to the EU? They tend to be less expensive that way.",
        "261": "Nope, sorry.",
        "262": "Alright, here you go. That'll be 18 gold coins and 72 silver pieces.",
        "263": "And the bubble wrap?",
        "264": "That's one more gold coin, friend.",
        "265": "Awesome, thanks a ton. You've been a great help.",
        "266": "Good evening, Saliva. What's that magical scent coming from your kitchen? What're you up to?",
        "267": "Cooking up a storm!",
        "268": "Are you skilled in the culinary arts?",
        "269": "I just graduated from a wizardly cooking academy! I'm planning on opening up a restaurant, so I've been putting my skills to the test.",
        "270": "What a fantastic idea! What are you whipping up at the moment?",
        "271": "I'm using my magic to steam some fish in a pressure cauldron. Have you ever tried steamed fish?",
        "272": "I have, but I must say the one I had at that particular eatery was not exactly appetizing. The fish was undercooked and a bit too salty.",
        "273": "Yeah, I know what you mean. I think the chef didn't allocate enough time for steaming and used too much of a certain herb.",
        "274": "I agree. But let's not dwell on that, shall we? Please give this one a try.",
        "275": "Thank you! Mmm, this is delicious!",
        "276": "Glad you like it! Your approval means a lot to me.",
        "277": "Aside from steamed fish, what other dishes are you skilled in?",
        "278": "I'm quite talented in creating dishes such as beef stew with potatoes, fried chicken, hot and sour soup, and the like.",
        "279": "Next Friday week is my wizarding birthday and I would love to invite you to cook a magical feast for my dinner party, would you be willing?",
        "280": "Why not? It would be a spellbinding opportunity for me to put my culinary magic to the test.",
        "281": "Many thanks, wizard.",
        "282": "It's my pleasure, fellow mage.",
        "283": "Wizarding Room Service. How may I assist you?",
        "284": "This is room 2012. Where is my enchanted laundry? You promised to have it delivered this morning.",
        "285": "Let me check for you. I am sorry, my lord. It seems that your order was mistaken as a standard one. Was it an express laundry you requested?",
        "286": "Indeed, I require the express enchantment.",
        "287": "My lord, we are deeply apologetic for the inconvenience. We will refund the charge and have your enchanted laundry delivered to your room within 3 hours. Does that suit?",
        "288": "That will do, thank you.",
        "289": "Pardon me, may I ask for a favor?",
        "290": "What is it?",
        "291": "Would you be so kind as to send this missive to the wizarding post office for me? I have a pressing appointment with the healer and do not have the time to visit the post office myself.",
        "292": "Of course. And while you are at the healer, could you possibly retrieve some magical cold remedy for me?",
        "293": "Excuse me, can I be of assistance?",
        "294": "Would you kindly fill my broomstick with unleaded fuel?",
        "295": "Certainly, what type of fuel do you require?",
        "296": "Unleaded, if you please.",
        "297": "Very well, my friend.",
        "298": "I would be delighted to come and discuss the financing for our wizarding imports.",
        "299": "Good day, wizard. I've been asked to negotiate the terms of our trade deal.",
        "300": "Yes, of course. I am ready to discuss the details. What do you propose?",
        "301": "I suggest that we use a spell of telepathy to transfer the payment directly to your account.",
        "302": "Interesting proposal, but what if the spell fails or is intercepted?",
        "303": "In that case, we have a backup plan. We can use a spell of invisibility to transport gold coins to your location.",
        "304": "I like the sound of that. It's always good to have a backup plan. What about the delivery date?",
        "305": "We can use a spell of teleportation to deliver the goods within 24 hours of the payment being received.",
        "306": "Excellent. Those terms sound fair to me. Let us cast the necessary spells and finalize the deal.",
        "307": "I heard rumors of a new wizard in town. Have you seen him yet?",
        "308": "No, I have not. What have you heard about this new wizard?",
        "309": "I've heard that he is incredibly powerful and that he can perform magic that no one has ever seen before.",
        "310": "Really? That's quite intriguing. I would love to see this new wizard in action.",
        "311": "I heard that he is also quite mysterious and that no one knows where he came from.",
        "312": "Interesting. It seems that this new wizard has many secrets to uncover.",
        "313": "Yes, I agree. Perhaps we should seek him out and ask for a demonstration of his powers.",
        "314": "I think that would be a wise idea. Let us set out on this quest and discover the truth about this mysterious new wizard.",
        "315": "Do you need a broomstick or a flying carpet to travel, wizard?",
        "316": "I prefer to use a flying carpet. It is faster and more comfortable for long journeys.",
        "317": "Very well, I will have one ready for you. Let us set off on our journey to find the new wizard.",
        "318": "Great choices! I think I'll join you for the stir-fried squids. And while we're at it, we should try their special wizard brew cocktails too.",
        "319": "Wizard brew cocktails? That sounds intriguing. What kind of ingredients do they use?",
        "320": "Only the finest magical ingredients, my friend. They infuse it with enchanted herbs and spices to give it that extra kick.",
        "321": "Wow, this place just keeps getting better. I can't wait to try one of those wizard brew cocktails.",
        "322": "Me too! I've heard they even cast a spell of good luck on each one for the lucky drinker.",
        "323": "Let's make a toast to good food, good drinks, and good company then.",
        "324": "Agreed! To good food, good drinks, and good company!",
        "325": "So, while we're waiting for our food, do you want to cast some spells to pass the time?",
        "326": "Sure! What kind of spell do you want to cast?",
        "327": "I was thinking of a spell of good fortune. Maybe we can help bring some good luck to the other diners here.",
        "328": "That's a great idea! And who knows, maybe our good fortune spell will bring us some extra delicious dishes to try!",
        "329": "You're not too shabby either. I'm craving some steamed dragon claw, it's said to taste like a slice of heaven.",
        "330": "Let's head to the wizarding tavern and secure a table to order some grub.",
        "331": "Hold on a moment. I need to inform the wizard behind the seafood counter of our order.",
        "332": "Very well. I'll wait for you inside the tavern.",
        "333": "What do you say we try some deep-fried phoenix feathers?",
        "334": "Where are you headed off to?",
        "335": "I have an appointment at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magic Maladies and Injuries.",
        "336": "Hop in, I'll apparate us there.",
        "337": "How much will it cost for the trip?",
        "338": "It will cost ten Galleons.",
        "339": "By the way, what time is it?",
        "340": "You can check the time on your wizarding watch. I've got radio time.",
        "341": "It's a quarter to midnight. Could you please speed up the apparition?",
        "342": "Of course.",
        "343": "You've made a wise choice. This Chinese tea set from Jingdezhen is quite unique.",
        "344": "Where did it come from?",
        "345": "It was crafted in Jingdezhen, the Capital of Porcelain.",
        "346": "Jingdezhen? Isn't it known as the 'Capital of Porcelain'?",
        "347": "Indeed it is.",
        "348": "This is exactly what I've been envisioning.",
        "349": "This porcelain is of the finest quality, renowned for its delicate eggshell texture.",
        "350": "It must be highly prized indeed.",
        "351": "But it's worth every galleon, I assure you.",
        "352": "Greetings, Miao Li. Where might you be headed?",
        "353": "Hello, I'm off to the apothecary to purchase some fruits.",
        "354": "Ah, would you do me a favor, if you wouldn't mind?",
        "355": "Of course, what can I assist you with?",
        "356": "Would you mind posting this letter for me on your way to the apothecary?",
        "357": "Of course. Would you like it sent via owl post or with a wizarding postage stamp?",
        "358": "Yes, I believe a wizarding postage stamp would be best. There are some important photographs enclosed and I wouldn't want them to go astray.",
        "359": "No problem, I would be happy to send your letter for you.",
        "360": "Many thanks.",
        "361": "You're welcome.",
        "362": "I seem to have misplaced my wand-phone in my broomstick. It's likely on the floor on the passenger side. Would you mind retrieving it for me so I can contact the Ministry of Magic?",
        "363": "Of course, I will retrieve it for you.",
        "364": "It appears to be damaged beyond repair. I fear I must go to St. Mungo's. Can you take me there?",
        "365": "I think it might be best to make a report to the Ministry of Magic first. Then we can proceed to St. Mungo's.",
        "366": "Blast it! I'm injured here. The Ministry could take all day to arrive!",
        "367": "I'm afraid you'll just have to be patient. I won't move my broomstick until the Ministry arrives. I'll pop into one of these nearby wizarding homes and use their fireplace to contact them. Don't worry, you'll make it to St. Mungo's in time.",
        "368": "It hurts quite badly.",
        "369": "To be truthful, you've failed your driving test.",
        "370": "How come?",
        "371": "There were several reasons for that.",
        "372": "What were they?",
        "373": "Essentially, you simply can't drive.",
        "374": "Can I take it again?",
        "375": "You can retake it in a couple of weeks.",
        "376": "Good morning. What's wrong?",
        "377": "Good morning, doctor. I have a splitting headache.",
        "378": "Very well, young man. Tell me, how did it start?",
        "379": "Yesterday, I had a runny nose. Now my nose is congested, I have a sore throat and I fear I have a temperature. I feel awful.",
        "380": "Don't worry, young man. Let me give you an examination. First, let me take a look at your throat. Open your mouth and say 'ah'.",
        "381": "Ah.",
        "382": "Your throat is inflamed and your tongue is heavily coated. You have all the symptoms of the flu.",
        "383": "What should I do then?",
        "384": "All you need is rest and to drink more water. I'll write you a prescription.",
        "385": "Thank you very much.",
        "386": "My dear, what's on the menu for dinner?",
        "387": "Red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms.",
        "388": "What about soup?",
        "389": "Spicy-tangy soup brewed with fire.",
        "390": "What magic do you mix with it?",
        "391": "Ginger, garlic scallion, hot pepper, and vinegar will do the trick.",
        "392": "Excellent, shall I assist?",
        "393": "No need, I can cast spells on my own.",
        "394": "Thank you, now I can watch the magical moving picture box.",
        "395": "Next time, you must conjure the dinner, though.",
        "396": "Agreed, I will work my culinary magic next time.",
        "397": "Greetings, I am Mike, of the house of Kara.",
        "398": "Mike, it's a pleasure to hear from you. How fare thee?",
        "399": "All is well, and yourself?",
        "400": "I am thriving, thanks.",
        "401": "Kara, I enjoyed our outing to the magical moving picture box the other night and was wondering if you'd like to join me again this Friday.",
        "402": "Mike, I don't think it's wise to socialize at the moment. I am focused on packing for my return to my family home.",
        "403": "We could meet for a cup of tea, perhaps?",
        "404": "I cannot afford any distractions right now, but I am grateful for the lovely evening we shared.",
        "405": "Sunset Inn, may I be of assistance?",
        "406": "Indeed, I have reserved a room for the 24th. A double, if you please.",
        "407": "One moment, I shall check. Yes, that is correct. You will be staying for three days.",
        "408": "I have decided to change the reservation from the 24th to the 28th.",
        "409": "Very well, it shall be done.",
        "410": "Are you engaged tomorrow morn?",
        "411": "I am not, what is the matter?",
        "412": "Someone must collect the Headmaster from the wizarding airport.",
        "413": "Alas, I had forgotten I must draft a report.",
        "414": "I offer my sincerest apologies for my tardiness, it's been a difficult day.",
        "415": "It's ten past six, we're running behind. However, dinner is set for half-past six.",
        "416": "I am aware, I am sorry. I lost my satchel.",
        "417": "I shall send an owl to the lost and found office.",
        "418": "I failed to think of it, thank you. And once again, I apologize for my lateness.",
        "419": "Nani's Tome Emporium. May I assist you?",
        "420": "Do you happen to have a copy of 'The Man and the Sea' by Ernest Hemingway?",
        "421": "Indeed, we have one tome left.",
        "422": "Might I hold it for you?",
        "423": "Do you possess maps of the downtown wizarding district?",
        "424": "Yes, here you are.",
        "425": "What is the cost?",
        "426": "It is gratis, there is no charge.",
        "427": "My gratitude, thank you very much.",
        "428": "Greetings, I would like to reserve a wizarding inn room.",
        "429": "Pray tell, is it true that its moniker is linked to someone?",
        "430": "Indeed, the towel bears the name of its creator, Gustave Eiffel.",
        "431": "Greetings! Trans Pacific Airlines, how may I be of assistance?",
        "432": "I'm ringing to cancel my reservation for the Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19th from Taipei to Minneapolis. Might I change it to the same flight, but on August 2nd instead of the 19th?",
        "433": "May I have your name, if you please?",
        "434": "I am Judy Wang.",
        "435": "Might you spell your name for me, dear?",
        "436": "My given name is spelled J-U-D-Y, and my surname is W-A-N-G.",
        "437": "Please be advised that this ticket incurs a fee of 75 dollars for any alterations or cancellations.",
        "438": "Very well. Where should I go to pay this fee?",
        "439": "At the airport. All right, Miss Wang, your Flight 8 on July 19th from Taipei to Minneapolis has been cancelled. Your new reservation is for the Trans Pacific Flight 8 from Taipei to Minneapolis at 9:30 a.m. on August 2nd.",
        "440": "That would be 1POJ7403.",
        "441": "Correct, it is.",
        "442": "Many thanks!",
        "443": "Is there anything else I can assist you with?",
        "444": "No, thank you. I am all set. Farewell.",
        "445": "Is this the supplies department?",
        "446": "Indeed, it is. How may I be of service?",
        "447": "This is Rachel from Human Resources. I require two boxes of company letterhead, a box of ballpoint pens, and a box of envelopes.",
        "448": "Very well. Not a problem. May I have your extension number?",
        "449": "John, may I introduce you to Charles Brown, our new manager at the airport.",
        "450": "Of course, how will I know him?",
        "451": "He's short, sturdy, and has light blonde hair.",
        "452": "Anything else I should look for?",
        "453": "If my memory serves me well, he has a mustache and fair skin.",
        "454": "How old is he?",
        "455": "He's in his late thirties.",
        "456": "I should have no trouble spotting him then. What time is his flight due?",
        "457": "It arrives at 2:30pm.",
        "458": "What can I get for you today?",
        "459": "I'd like to have a hamburger, please.",
        "460": "Would you like cheese on that?",
        "461": "No, thank you.",
        "462": "Would you like a drink as well?",
        "463": "Yes, a soda would be great.",
        "464": "What kind of soda would you like?",
        "465": "A Sprite would be fine, thank you.",
        "466": "Of course, no trouble at all.",
        "467": "I would also like a bag of chips, please.",
        "468": "Will that be all for you today?",
        "469": "That concludes our business.",
        "470": "Do share with me your knowledge of insurance matters.",
        "471": "At wizarding college, I studied the arts of international banking, including various insurance courses. And I honed my skills during my internship at an insurance firm.",
        "472": "Why have you taken an interest in becoming an insurance wizard?",
        "473": "I am passionate about helping others and I understand the significance of securing one's possessions through insurance.",
        "474": "Have you any prior experience in sales?",
        "475": "Indeed, I have. I have served as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd.",
        "476": "Are you well-liked by those you come into contact with?",
        "477": "Indeed, I possess a way with people that often leads to favorable outcomes.",
        "478": "Ah, here we are.",
        "479": "This is the establishment I mentioned to you earlier.",
        "480": "Would you prefer a seat near the window, friend?",
        "481": "Very well.",
        "482": "Let us peruse the menu. Oh dear, it seems there is no menu. Could you kindly ask the patrons at the next table if they would be so kind as to allow us to see theirs?",
        "483": "Of course. Excuse me. Pardon the intrusion, but could we have a look at your menu? I see, they do not have one either.",
        "484": "Do you have intentions of purchasing a broomstick?",
        "485": "I am still considering it. May I inquire as to its cost?",
        "486": "350 Knuts.",
        "487": "Oh dear, it seems a bit steep. Could you extend a more reasonable offer?",
        "488": "Your discount has already been taken into account. Normally, we ask 400 Knuts, but during this sale period, we are able to offer a special price.",
        "489": "Can it not be procured at a lesser price, my dear wizard?",
        "490": "Alas, this is the fairest of prices. No further reduction shall be made.",
        "491": "Very well then, might I be able to pay with wizarding traveler's drafts?",
        "492": "I'm afraid not, the payment in gold galleons is most preferred.",
        "493": "Do you have a moment to spare?",
        "494": "Of course, what can I assist you with?",
        "495": "I am having some trouble operating this dragon scale press.",
        "496": "Let me see, have you tried turning the fire-breathing knob?",
        "497": "Ah, yes, my apologies.",
        "498": "Now try pressing the dragon's tail button.",
        "499": "Oh dear, it seems to be out of dragon scales. Do you have any extra?",
        "500": "Just a moment, I'll go retrieve some for you.",
        "501": "I am in need of help with the broomstick dryer and washer.",
        "502": "What seems to be the issue?",
        "503": "I cannot seem to figure out how to turn them on.",
        "504": "Do you have any flimsy flying feathers?",
        "505": "I did not know I needed feathers.",
        "506": "The washer requires three feathers and the dryer requires five.",
        "507": "Where do I place the feathers?",
        "508": "Simply place the feathers in the slot, and the machines should activate.",
        "509": "Is that all that must be done, my friend?",
        "510": "That is all there is, indeed.",
        "511": "I am grateful for your assistance in this matter.",
        "512": "If there is anything else you require, simply let me know.",
        "513": "Do you have any further inquiries?",
        "514": "Yes, must I work an entire year before I am able to take a holiday?",
        "515": "Indeed, once you have been here a year, you shall be eligible for a three-day leave.",
        "516": "Only three days, you say?",
        "517": "That is the company policy, I'm afraid.",
        "518": "And what happens if I have exhausted my sick days before the end of the year? Will I lose pay if I am unwell for an extra day or two?",
        "519": "Unfortunately, that is indeed the company policy.",
        "520": "It is the same as the last place where I was employed. I had hoped that things would be different here.",
        "521": "I am famished beyond measure.",
        "522": "Indeed, I too am quite hungry.",
        "523": "Where did you have in mind for us to go for our meal?",
        "524": "I was considering that we should go to the great hall for our repast.",
        "525": "I don't recall ever having dined in the great hall before.",
        "526": "I actually quite enjoy the fare served there.",
        "527": "Does the great hall offer a diverse array of edibles?",
        "528": "They have anything your heart desires, my friend.",
        "529": "I've been considering purchasing some delicious Chinese cuisine.",
        "530": "I savored some delicious chow mein at the Great Hall. It was truly scrumptious.",
        "531": "We can dine at the Great Hall.",
        "532": "I believe the fare at the Great Hall will be most enjoyable.",
        "533": "Mr. Brown, allow me to present you with this draft of the contract. Let us peruse the provisions and determine if we are in agreement on all of them. Afterwards, I shall create an original copy. Then, all that will be left to do is to complete the contract and affix our signatures.",
        "534": "That shall be acceptable.",
        "535": "The contract must be written in both Chinese and English, both of which shall hold equal weight.",
        "536": "Very well. If you'll excuse me, I would like to give it a thorough review. Hmm, you've done a splendid job. It is well-prepared.",
        "537": "My gratitude to you.",
        "538": "I suggest we only discuss the provisions and points where our opinions differ in order to conserve time.",
        "539": "A wise proposal.",
        "540": "Let us begin with Clause Two regarding the packing. Our standard practice is to ship our equipment in containers, which is both time-saving and cost-effective. However, your contract specifies the use of wooden cases. Hence, we request that the contract include the words 'containers are acceptable.'",
        "541": "Agreed.",
        "542": "Regarding the shipment, we are producing a full set of equipment for you, and it will not all be ready at once. Thus, would you permit us to make partial shipments?",
        "543": "I comprehend your stance.",
        "544": "I desire to purchase a black suit.",
        "545": "Of course. Would you prefer a double-breasted or single-breasted suit?",
        "546": "I would prefer a single-breasted suit.",
        "547": "What about this one? It's an elegant three-piece suit.",
        "548": "That appears quite striking. Do you have any neckties available?",
        "549": "Greetings! It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Diane.",
        "550": "Greetings, Jack. It's lovely to meet you as well.",
        "551": "I presume you've had a change of heart regarding our proposal, Diane.",
        "552": "Indeed. After much consideration, I must admit the quality of your air conditioners is most impressive. The only issue at hand is the cost.",
        "553": "It doesn't surprise me, many customers share your sentiment. Might you have any suggestions? Our sales associate informed your secretary that the price may be negotiable.",
        "554": "That's why I made the journey to your office today. Our suggestion is for the model WE-506 to be priced at $590, as similar air conditioners from other companies are typically priced between $579 and $649.",
        "555": "That is true, but if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product, you'll agree that $679 is not excessive, especially with a 10% discount we're offering.",
        "556": "I can see your point. So that would be $611 per set. However, that is still higher than the market price. Is there any way to lower the cost, Jack?",
        "557": "Well, given the quantity of your order, we could reduce the price further to $600. That's the lowest we can go. What do you think of that?",
        "558": "Agreed. $600 per set it is then.",
        "559": "Very good. Many thanks.",
        "560": "Have we met before?",
        "561": "I'm not certain. You look familiar, though.",
        "562": "Are you Mr. Stevenson, by any chance?",
        "563": "Yes, that's correct. And you are Mr. Jones, if I'm not mistaken.",
        "564": "And with that, we've covered all the basic information about our company. I trust you have a good understanding of who we are.",
        "565": "Indeed, I have a general knowledge of your company.",
        "566": "Once we have the final results, we shall send word to you.",
        "567": "And when can I expect a response at the latest?",
        "568": "Should you pass the interview, the personnel department will inform you within two fortnights.",
        "569": "But if I don't pass, shall I expect to hear from you?",
        "570": "I'm afraid not. Give it a fortnight, if you don't receive a Howler, then I'm afraid it means your application was unsuccessful.",
        "571": "Then is there any hope for me getting this position?",
        "572": "I'm sorry, but the final decision is not in my hands, and I must confer with the other interviewing panel members.",
        "573": "Understood. Regardless of the outcome, I've gained much insight from our discussion.",
        "574": "A commendable outlook, well done.",
        "575": "Many thanks for offering me the chance to interview.",
        "576": "You're welcome, it was my pleasure.",
        "577": "I've a bit of a tummy ache.",
        "578": "Best you lie down then, a bit of rest is just what you need.",
        "579": "Very well, I shall.",
        "580": "What sort of personality would you say you have?",
        "581": "I'd say I'm quite active and full of energy. I tackle things with enthusiasm and don't like to leave a job half-done.",
        "582": "Would you consider yourself introverted or extroverted?",
        "583": "I'd say I'm quite outgoing, I enjoy socializing and doing things with others.",
        "584": "What do you believe is the most important factor in your happiness?",
        "585": "I firmly believe that having close friends is the key. One cannot live in solitude, after all. A true friend is a treasure indeed, and the more I have, the merrier I am.",
        "586": "What sort of people do you prefer to work alongside?",
        "587": "I value honesty, commitment, and integrity in my colleagues.",
        "588": "I'd like to take a moment to extend a warm welcome to Monica, our newest addition to the finance department. We've hired Monica for her expertise as a professional accountant, and I'm sure you'll all find her an asset to the team. With her extensive accounting experience, I'm positive you'll all learn from her.",
        "589": "Hail and well met! I am Monica, newly arrived to the finance department. 'Tis an honor to make your acquaintance and I eagerly look forward to working alongside all of thee. I shall do my utmost to get up to speed with our tasks as swiftly as possible. Pray, call me Monica; that is what all others do.",
        "590": "Were ye in a position of leadership while at Hogwarts?",
        "591": "Indeed I was. I served as the Head of the Student Council during my time at Hogwarts.",
        "592": "Didst thou receive any accolades or awards while at Hogwarts?",
        "593": "Yes, I was awarded the title of 'Excellent Party Member' for four consecutive academic years.",
        "594": "Didst thou participate in any club activities during your days at Hogwarts?",
        "595": "Yes, I was a proud member of the Student Poetry Society. 'Tis a favourite pastime of mine, writing verse.",
        "596": "What other extracurricular activities didst thou typically engage in at Hogwarts?",
        "597": "On occasion, I would play a friendly game of wizard's chess or fly on my broomstick.",
        "598": "Margaret, let us discuss the preparations for our company retreat which is to take place next month. We must secure a suitable location, make arrangements for guest speakers, door prizes, activities, and lodgings. 'Tis also of utmost importance that we determine which of our staff will be eligible and available to attend. We need an accurate headcount so that we may make the necessary reservations.",
        "599": "What are the criteria for staff to attend the retreat? Shall it be limited to our management team or shall lower level employees also be invited to attend?",
        "600": "Lower level employees shall not be in attendance. The retreat is for training purposes, specifically for our management team. Our aim is to create a well-oiled machine at the executive level, and to foster a sense of camaraderie among the team, we've included some leisure activities as well. That's the purpose of the retreat.",
        "601": "I believe yoga may be suitable for me.",
        "602": "And why might that be?",
        "603": "Because 'tis not demanding of great deal of energy and is thus more manageable for me.",
        "604": "But I've seen witches and wizards perspiring heavily during yoga as well.",
        "605": "I cannot say for certain, but I'd like to give it a try. I am in dire need of some form of exercise to shed some weight.",
        "606": "Thou may want to try taking a dip in the lake. 'Tis a great way to stay fit.",
        "607": "We are in search of a secretary who is bilingual. Wouldst thou say that thou art proficient in both written and spoken English?",
        "608": "I daresay my command of the English language is quite impressive. My academic record showcases my mastery, having earned a Bachelor of Arts in the subject, where I honed my linguistic and literary skills through extensive study.",
        "609": "It's not a problem. Might I have the pleasure of knowing your full name?",
        "610": "Of course, I am John Sandals.",
        "611": "Greetings Mr. Sandals, I am Michelle, at your service. What dates will you require the room?",
        "612": "I plan to be there from the 14th to the 17th of April.",
        "613": "Our rooms have a new rate, sir. Are you comfortable with this arrangement?",
        "614": "Well, it depends on the price, naturally. What is the rate?",
        "615": "The nightly rate is $308.",
        "616": "That shall not be a problem for me.",
        "617": "Fantastic! Would you prefer a smoking or non-smoking room?",
        "618": "Non-smoking, I cannot abide the smell.",
        "619": "Non-smoking it is. And, will a queen-sized bed be acceptable?",
        "620": "No problem.",
        "621": "Excellent, Mr. Sandals. Your reservation is confirmed. May I have your phone number, so I may reach you if necessary?",
        "622": "Certainly! My phone number is 626-555-1739.",
        "623": "Thank you very much, Mr. Sandals. We look forward to your arrival!",
        "624": "Might I have my bill, if you please?",
        "625": "Of course, sir.",
        "626": "I'm afraid there has been a mistake.",
        "627": "I apologize, sir. What seems to be the trouble?",
        "628": "I believe I have been charged twice for the same item. You see, the figure of 6.5 galleons appears here and then again here.",
        "629": "What are your quill skills like, my dear?",
        "630": "I can transcribe at a pace of 80 words per minute without error, and my hand is quick enough to take dictation in the English language at a speed of 120 words per minute.",
        "631": "Are these the robes you desire to have cleaned, madam?",
        "632": "Aye, when might I retrieve them?",
        "633": "If they are collected posthaste, you may have them returned to you this very evening.",
        "634": "That is acceptable. Please ensure my suit is treated with a scouring charm, if you would be so kind.",
        "635": "Very well, kindly fill out the registry first.",
        "636": "What ails me, good Healer? I find myself feeling quite fatigued of late.",
        "637": "Your blood pressure is the cause, I'm afraid. 'Tis far too elevated.",
        "638": "What could be the root of this issue?",
        "639": "O'erwork, amongst other causes. One cannot toil for 24 hours a day. You must take it easier, lest you drive yourself to exhaustion.",
        "640": "But I cannot simply cease my labors.",
        "641": "You must, I fear. And have you not noticed? You weigh 200 stone. 'Tis far too much for one of your stature.",
        "642": "Are you suggesting I must shed some weight?",
        "643": "Aye. You must reduce your intake of bread and potatoes, and take more exercise.",
        "644": "You rise early, Tom. What do you do with your mornings?",
        "645": "I engage in physical activity. The morning hours are the most precious of the day and should not be wasted. I seize the time and put it to good use.",
        "646": "So, you spend your mornings building your strength. Where do you typically train?",
        "647": "Typically, I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up. The admission is free of charge. Then, I commence my regimen.",
        "648": "Do you follow the same regimen every day?",
        "649": "Nay, I have made sure to maintain a delicate balance between various exercises - bars in parallel, press-ups, crunches, bunny hops, and a five-kilometer gallop, and so forth. I alternate them through the weekdays. At times, when I find myself feeling under the weather, I might simply meander through the gardens to clear my thoughts.",
        "650": "Why not simply remain in bed on such days, when your body is not up for any form of exertion?",
        "651": "Keeping up with good habits can be challenging, as you are aware. I fear that if I were to remain in bed for a day, it might only become harder to rise early the following day. Furthermore, a leisurely walk in the cool morning air is a delight. In the gardens, one encounters groups of elders who might be singing grand operas, playing musical instruments, or simply socializing and exchanging gossip. It is always intriguing to observe them.",
        "652": "Indeed, singing can be a means of keeping fit, not only of the body but also the mind.",
        "653": "I am seeking recommendations for some beauty products. Might you be able to suggest any?",
        "654": "Pond's is widely regarded as the finest choice.",
        "655": "Unfortunately, they are quite costly.",
        "656": "Ah, but today they are available at a special price.",
        "657": "Perfect, that is just what I was hoping for.",
        "658": "Steven, I am to embark upon my first journey by air tomorrow. Might you be able to offer any advice and caution me on what I should keep an eye out for?",
        "659": "Firstly, it is imperative that you get a good night's rest to ensure that you are well-rested and ready to conquer the effects of jet lag. Such journeys can often leave one feeling fatigued for several days after.",
        "660": "I shall retire to bed early this evening, then.",
        "661": "Are you prone to airsickness, perchance?",
        "662": "I cannot say for certain, but I am prone to motion sickness when traveling by carriage.",
        "663": "It might be wise to bring along some remedies for airsickness, just in case.",
        "664": "Thank you, I shall do so.",
        "665": "Might we schedule a time to view houses together?",
        "666": "Would the mornings or the afternoons be more convenient for you?",
        "667": "Either would suit me just fine.",
        "668": "There are several houses available for viewing this coming weekend in your area. Does that work for you?",
        "669": "I could take a sabbatical from Hogwarts, or we could journey to Hogsmeade for the weekend, either way.",
        "670": "We could convene at the wizarding real estate agency, or I could collect you from your wizarding abode.",
        "671": "I am departing from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, so perhaps I could merely meet you at the first domicile we shall inspect.",
        "672": "I can think of five wizarding homes that we ought to survey. It will occupy most of the day.",
        "673": "I would like to see as many as possible, if it please you.",
        "674": "When I have received confirmation from the owners, I shall send an owl with our itinerary for the day.",
        "675": "Do you offer a wizarding tour to Hollywood?",
        "676": "Indeed, here is the schedule. Which plan suits your fancy best?",
        "677": "The seven-day sojourn shall suffice. Pray, how much does this tour cost?",
        "678": "Three hundred galleons.",
        "679": "We shall take the journey. Could you provide us with a brochure?",
        "680": "Of course, here you are.",
        "681": "What is the matter? Matters are becoming disordered. You persist in intermeddling where you are not wanted.",
        "682": "What do you imply?",
        "683": "Presently, I am tasked with instructing new students, but you persist in interfering with my authority by advocating your methods. I am aware that you are a talented wizard with much to prove, but I do not approve of your manner.",
        "684": "Mother, upon your return to our wizarding abode, kindly purchase a cloak, a robe, and a sweater...",
        "685": "Enough is enough, I comprehend.",
        "686": "Mr. Chen, would you object if I were to smoke a wizarding cigarette?",
        "687": "I apologize, Mrs. Lin. We do not allow smoking within the wizarding office.",
        "688": "Good morning, may I assist you?",
        "689": "I would like to partake in an American-style breakfast, including fried eggs with the yolks facing upwards.",
        "690": "And what type of juice would you prefer, good sir?",
        "691": "A juice to accompany breakfast and a black coffee, brewed extra strong, if you please.",
        "692": "Very good, sir. An American breakfast with sunny-side-up fried eggs, breakfast juice, and a strong black coffee. Is that correct, sir?",
        "693": "Indeed, that is correct.",
        "694": "Would there be anything else, sir?",
        "695": "No, that shall be all. Thank you.",
        "696": "Good morning, sir. Your requested breakfast has arrived.",
        "697": "Just place it on the table, if you would be so kind.",
        "698": "Is there anything else I can bring you, sir?",
        "699": "No, thank you. Ah, wait, could I trouble you for some juice to stock the minibar?",
        "700": "Certainly, sir. Which type of juice would you prefer: tomato or orange?",
        "701": "Tomato or orange juice, if you please.",
        "702": "At once, sir. Could you sign this bill first, please? Thank you, sir.",
        "703": "Shall we leave a gratuity? This service has been quite excellent.",
        "704": "I believe so. How much is considered standard?",
        "705": "How about a ten percent tip? That would come to around six galleons.",
        "706": "That seems fair and reasonable.",
        "707": "When does the train for Tibet depart, may I ask?",
        "708": "It shall depart at three in the afternoon, good sir or madam.",
        "709": "When shall it arrive, good sir?",
        "710": "It is due to arrive at the hour of 7 and thirty minutes on the morrow.",
        "711": "Pray tell, how much is the cost of a ticket?",
        "712": "The cost of a coach ticket is 86 galleons and a berth shall cost thee 175 galleons.",
        "713": "One berth, if you please.",
        "714": "Taxi, ho!",
        "715": "Where might you be headed, kind sir?",
        "716": "To the Beijing Library, if you would be so kind.",
        "717": "Step inside, if you please.",
        "718": "Is the journey to the Beijing Library a long one?",
        "719": "It shall take us approximately thirty minutes, for it is the hour of rush.",
        "720": "Thirty minutes shall suffice. Fifty minutes remain before the library shall open its doors. Observe, what are they doing in the square?",
        "721": "It is an exhibition of Chinese jades, held annually. A magnificent collection of jades is on display and for sale.",
        "722": "Sounds delightful! Could we stop for a moment? I must purchase a few trinkets for my friends.",
        "723": "It shall be my pleasure.",
        "724": "How many pieces of luggage shall you be checking in, good sir?",
        "725": "I shall be checking in three bags and a suitcase. This is my luggage to be checked.",
        "726": "Do you have any luggage to carry on?",
        "727": "Nay.",
        "728": "Place your luggage upon the scale, if you please. Ah, it seems your luggage is over the weight limit.",
        "729": "Pray tell, how much would the charge for an excess of baggage be?",
        "730": "Twenty-two galleons.",
        "731": "Here you are, sir.",
        "732": "This is your voucher, sir. You may collect your belongings with it upon your return. Safe travels!",
        "733": "Thank you kindly!",
        "734": "On what date do you desire to depart, sir?",
        "735": "Might you have any available seats on the 16th of September?",
        "736": "Let us see... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked. However, I have seats available on the 17th.",
        "737": "The 17th shall be acceptable.",
        "738": "And when might you be returning, sir?",
        "739": "Hmmm... I believe it shall be the 28th.",
        "740": "Very well, you are booked on American Airlines flight 710, departing from JFK at 6.",
        "741": "Excellent, thank you very much.",
        "742": "I seek to purchase a black suit.",
        "743": "Might you have any specific brands in mind, miss?",
        "744": "No, I rarely wear suits in my daily life. I require one for my sister's wedding ceremony.",
        "745": "I see. Might I suggest this one? It is quite inexpensive, however, it may not endure long.",
        "746": "Though it appears quite handsome. May I try it on?",
        "747": "Very well, the mirror is over there.",
        "748": "How may I be of assistance, miss?",
        "749": "I seek a pair of enchanted footwear.",
        "750": "Would thee prefer stilettos or flat-soled shoes?",
        "751": "High heels, if you please. I aim to don them for formal gatherings.",
        "752": "Greetings, Jim. Dost thou have a moment to spare?",
        "753": "Certainly, what brings you to me?",
        "754": "A number of us are forming a quidditch team. Would thou like to join us?",
        "755": "I'm afraid I have little knowledge of the sport, as quidditch is not as popular in my homeland.",
        "756": "Fear not, we shall guide thee.",
        "757": "Is it similar to the game of Muggle football?",
        "758": "Nay, it is more akin to hockey, except the ball is larger and nary a stick is employed.",
        "759": "I shall visit and observe a match one day, to better understand the sport.",
        "760": "A wise choice. I'm sure you'll find it to your liking, given a chance.",
        "761": "Do you recall what the movie rating system signifies?",
        "762": "Indeed, G is for General Audiences, PG signifies Parental Guidance is recommended, R is restricted to those under 18 years of age, and X indicates explicit content.",
        "763": "Do people still take heed of those classifications?",
        "764": "Do you remember the days when children were not permitted to attend PG-rated movies without a guardian?",
        "765": "I recall that X-rated films were scarce to come by.",
        "766": "Nowadays, with video rentals, it is a matter of personal discretion.",
        "767": "Aye, I've not seen theaters turn away patrons due to age restrictions in quite some time.",
        "768": "We are now left to make our own decisions about what we do and do not wish to view.",
        "769": "Pray, why are thou struggling in thy class?",
        "770": "The teachings are quite abstract, making it difficult to comprehend.",
        "771": "Reservation, may I be of assistance?",
        "772": "Indeed, I seek to reserve a chamber for next Monday.",
        "773": "One moment, if thou wouldst. Allow me to verify it.",
        "774": "By the by, I desire a spacious chamber.",
        "775": "At present, we have a suite for four, would thou like to book it?",
        "776": "Aye, that is what I seek. I shall take the chamber for two days.",
        "777": "Hail Mel! Art thou game for a match of tennis today?",
        "778": "Alas, I cannot! I must attend to work, retrieve Jake and Maddie from Hogwarts, provide them with an afternoon refreshment, then accompany Jake to Quidditch practice and Maddie to dance lessons.",
        "779": "Thou dost sound fatigued. Perhaps thou shouldst seek the aid of a house-elf to assist thee. She could fetch the young ones from Hogwarts and accompany them to their after-school activities. She could also assist thee with household chores, and run errands.",
        "780": "Oh, I know not... it is a difficult task to find the right house-elf. Thou must consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities thou wouldst give her, and how she interacts with the young ones. I would love to have such assistance, but it is a daunting task to find the right match.",
        "781": "I believe thou shouldst give it due consideration! This way thou wouldst not have to manage such a busy schedule, and thou wouldst still be able to spend time with the young ones in the evenings. I could refer thee to a most excellent house-elf.",
        "782": "Oh, that is grand. Many thanks Grace. Could thou give me her number? I shall discuss it with Dan and give her a call tomorrow. Perchance, this way I shall not be so weary each day, and Dan and I might even have the chance to go...",
        "783": "Canst thou tell that I am filled with excitement?",
        "784": "Pray, what has thou become so excited about?",
        "785": "I cast my vote today.",
        "786": "Was this thy first time?",
        "787": "I turned 18 just last month.",
        "788": "Thou art most fortunate.",
        "789": "What art thou implying?",
        "790": "For thou hast come of age in a year of great political upheaval.",
        "791": "I had not considered such a thing.",
        "792": "Had thou not?",
        "793": "Indeed not, but I remain exhilarated nonetheless.",
        "794": "Thou should be, for thou art now a part of history.",
        "795": "May I be of assistance?",
        "796": "Aye. I seek a pair of shoes to purchase.",
        "797": "Hast thou a specific design in mind?",
        "798": "Perchance sneakers or sturdy footwear.",
        "799": "Is there a particular brand thou wouldst prefer?",
        "800": "Might I inspect that pair of canvas shoes? They appear quite lovely.",
        "801": "Observe, how grand and magnificent the tour of the Tiananmen Gate is!",
        "802": "What is the significance of the Tiananmen?",
        "803": "It is the largest public square in the world, home to a monument to the people's hero and the Chairman Mao memorial hall to the south. To the west stands the Great Hall of the People, and to the east, two museums. ",
        "804": "And what is that yonder?",
        "805": "Why, that be the Forbidden City, to the north of the Gate building.",
        "806": "All sights in China are most beguiling. A journey to this land is most certainly worth one's time. My thanks for thy guidance, and I shall miss thee.",
        "807": "I have collided with a fence post, resulting in injury. What say thou to this matter? Blast and damnation, it hurts considerably!",
        "808": "We must hasten thee to a wizarding hospital. I shall take thee upon the back of my broomstick.",
        "809": "I narrowly escaped death's grasp, careening down the road at a breakneck speed of forty-five miles per hour. The corner was slick with gravel, and I lost control, skidding towards oblivion.",
        "810": "Indeed, I too was nearly thrown off course. Now then, let's tighten this tourniquet and stem the flow of blood. Wrap the wound with bandages, and then we shall be off. By Merlin's beard, this hurts.",
        "811": "Very well, I am tightening it as we speak. Tell me when to stop.",
        "812": "There, it's done.",
        "813": "Mr. James, I know that office hours have come to a close, but might I trouble you to work this weekend and complete the translations?",
        "814": "Alas, I have a prior engagement this weekend. Let me see...",
        "815": "My apologies, but I am willing to offer double pay for your time and effort. Will this do?",
        "816": "That is most generous. When do you require these translations?",
        "817": "I require them by Monday afternoon for a conference. Do you think it can be done?",
        "818": "I shall do my utmost to make it so.",
        "819": "Thank you so much, Mr. James.",
        "820": "Fear not, for your little one is safe and sound in my care.",
        "821": "How may I ever repay your kindness? I am in your debt.",
        "822": "My sincerest apologies, sir. My mode of transportation has failed me.",
        "823": "A shame. Is there anything we can do to assist?",
        "824": "I fear not.",
        "825": "Then I must call for alternative transportation, lest I be tardy.",
        "826": "Greetings. I seek to have my footwear repaired.",
        "827": "Pray, what seems to be the issue?",
        "828": "I'll just go and check it for you , sir .",
        "829": "Good evening , madam . Can I help you ?",
        "830": "Yes . I bought this sheet here yesterday .",
        "831": "Anything wrong with it ?",
        "832": "Yes . When I spread it out back home , I found this hole .",
        "833": "Oh , how awful ! May I have a look at the invoice ?",
        "834": "Here it is .",
        "835": "Well . please accept our sincere apologies , I'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .",
        "836": "That's very kind of you . Thank you .",
        "837": "We're sorry that this has happened , and I guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again .",
        "838": "I need to buy some flowers for my wife .",
        "839": "Perhaps you'd be interested in red roses .",
        "840": "What would the roses cost me ?",
        "841": "They're only $ 20 a dozen .",
        "842": "I like the sound of that .",
        "843": "Yes , that is today's sale price .",
        "844": "A dozen will be fine .",
        "845": "Is there anything else you'd like to get ?",
        "846": "No , thank you .",
        "847": "These roses should make your wife very happy .",
        "848": "Gaze upon the heels of thy footwear, for they appear to be slanting.",
        "849": "Fear not, for I possess the skill to repair them with precision.",
        "850": "Pray tell, what shall be the cost of the mending?",
        "851": "Six coins of yuan shall be the price, and I shall restore thy heels to their former glory.",
        "852": "I must say, the price seems quite steep. I would offer four yuan instead, or I may seek assistance elsewhere.",
        "853": "Very well, I shall attend to the mending of thy heels.",
        "854": "May I inquire, how long shall the task take? Might I sit and wait as thou repairst them?",
        "855": "Indeed, the task shall be completed in but a few moments.",
        "856": "Fantastic! I shall take my seat here and wait with anticipation.",
        "857": "Greetings!",
        "858": "Greetings, is this Stefan whom I address?",
        "859": "Alas, thou hast dialed the incorrect number. There is no one by the name of Stefan here.",
        "860": "Surely, thou jest. I called previously and spoke with Stefan himself.",
        "861": "I assure thee, thou hast the wrong number. This number hath been mine for over two decades.",
        "862": "This cannot be so. I recall the number distinctly. Is it not 1199886?",
        "863": "Nay, the number is incorrect. It is 1199866. Thou hast dialed an incorrect number.",
        "864": "My apologies for the inconvenience. I am truly sorry for bothering thee.",
        "865": "Fear not, such mistakes are common amongst us all.",
        "866": "My sincerest apologies once again.",
        "867": "Think nothing of it.",
        "868": "Good day, kind sir. How may I be of assistance?",
        "869": "Good day to you as well. I am here to visit with Rochelle Davis, the Head of the Department of Human Resources.",
        "870": "Do you have a prior appointment with her?",
        "871": "Indeed I do. I am scheduled to meet with her at half past ten this morn.",
        "872": "Very well. May I have your name, please?",
        "873": "Bruce Green, at your service.",
        "874": "Thank you. Please be seated, she will attend to you promptly.",
        "875": "My gratitude, kind sir.",
        "876": "Excuse me, good sir. Might I inquire as to the time?",
        "877": "Ah, it is near the hour of eleven and twenty.",
        "878": "Thank you for your kindness.",
        "879": "You are most welcome. May I observe that the rain is coming down quite heavily today?",
        "880": "Yes, I was in a hurry and alas, I forgot my umbrella.",
        "881": "Fear not, I have one. Would you care to share it as we walk? Which way are you headed?",
        "882": "That is most generous of you. I am bound for the Garden Hotel.",
        "883": "As it happens, I too am headed that way. Shall we make the journey together?",
        "884": "Indeed, I would be delighted to join you.",
        "885": "I am most intrigued by the art of Chinese antiques.",
        "886": "We have a magnificent collection of Chinese antiques, including an array of landscape paintings, portraits, and the most magnificent flower and bird paintings you have ever seen.",
        "887": "I would like to purchase a flower and bird painting, if I may.",
        "888": "What do you think of this painting of cranes amongst pine trees, crafted by a renowned painter during the King Dynasty?",
        "889": "By Merlin, they look almost lifelike.",
        "890": "And, in traditional wizarding belief, cranes and pine trees symbolize a long and fruitful life.",
        "891": "It's time for me to depart. My name is Ruth Carson. Might I have my bill, please?",
        "892": "Yes, it comes to 167 Galleons.",
        "893": "Much obliged.",
        "894": "Well, Mitzuko-san, I do hope you enjoy your stay. This restaurant is my personal favorite in Taipei. It brings back memories of my travels throughout Europe during my younger years.",
        "895": "It looks truly magical. Very authentic.",
        "896": "The chef was trained in Florence. Their pasta dishes are simply magnificent.",
        "897": "Understood. What do you recommend?",
        "898": "Hmm... You must try the mushroom fettucine. It's a spellbinding dish.",
        "899": "Is it particularly salty?",
        "900": "Not in the slightest. It has a very delicate flavor.",
        "901": "What does 'Duppa del Giono' mean? I apologize, I'm not sure how to pronounce it.",
        "902": "Oh, it means 'soup of the day'. I'll ask the waiter what they have available today. Have you considered trying the mussels cooked in the Italian way? They're delectable.",
        "903": "No, I haven't. That sounds like an excellent idea.",
        "904": "I am calling to inquire about the available position for an usher.",
        "905": "Is there anything in particular you would like to know?",
        "906": "What qualities are you seeking in an applicant for the position of an usher?",
        "907": "We require the candidate for the role of usher to be comely, stand no less than 5 feet 5 inches tall, and have an affinity for smiling.",
        "908": "Greetings, good Madam, may I assist you in finding something?",
        "909": "Indeed, I am searching for a camera to purchase.",
        "910": "We have a vast array of choices. Do you have a preference between a point-and-shoot or a more sophisticated one? Might I inquire if you're purchasing this for yourself or someone else?",
        "911": "In truth, I am seeking a camera for my husband.",
        "912": "Ah, in that case, I would recommend a fine entry-level digital SLR.",
        "913": "Might I have a glance at the options available, good Sir?",
        "914": "Of course, follow me. This here is the...",
        "915": "The Canon Eos. It is adequate, however, I am in search of something with improved performance in low light, a finer display panel, and a longer battery life.",
        "916": "Oh, hm, the Nikon D60 is a sound choice.",
        "917": "Yes, but what lens is included in this kit? I do not desire a cumbersome telephoto lens.",
        "918": "Oh, let's see, it appears to come with an 18-55 mm lens. A standard option that should suffice. After all, my husband will not be stalking celebrities or anything of the sort!",
        "919": "So, um, might I tempt you with any accessories...?",
        "920": "Accessories? Do you have polarizing filters available?",
        "921": "Polarizing filters? Let me see... I am afraid we are currently out of stock, good Madam.",
        "922": "Nonsense! There are some right here!",
        "923": "Oh my! It seems we have polarizing filters available after all!",
        "924": "Many thanks for your assistance, Ralph!",
        "925": "It was my pleasure, good Madam.",
        "926": "May I be of service to you, good Madam?",
        "927": "Pray tell, where might I find the Apparition point for New York?",
        "928": "You must first check in at Counter No. 4.",
        "929": "Is that the one yonder?",
        "930": "Indeed, then follow the signage to Platform 85.",
        "931": "My thanks. You have been most helpful.",
        "932": "Mr. Crandall, I regret to say that I cannot fathom the reasoning behind starting this project anew. 'Twill require a great deal of effort.",
        "933": "That is quite true. But such is the nature of our profession, Maria. There can be no question that the current project is unacceptable.",
        "934": "I concur. Yet, I believe that a few modifications could remedy the situation. Might I have the chance to prove myself?",
        "935": "Very well, Maria. I shall grant you until the hour of four tomorrow to produce satisfactory results, else you shall have to repeat the endeavor.",
        "936": "I believe 'tis time to confront my admirer and set him to rights.",
        "937": "Is that so? How do you plan to make contact?",
        "938": "I shall leave him a message, affixed to my workstation.",
        "939": "What does it say? Do you anticipate that he shall read it?",
        "940": "He shall. It states, 'I have a sweet tooth. Meet me at half past two in the carriage park.' ",
        "941": "Might I observe from the window?",
        "942": "Nay, I shall keep you abreast of the situation later. At present, I must locate Vince.",
        "943": "There is still much left. Would you care for another serving?",
        "944": "Aye, I should like that. 'Tis quite delicious.",
        "945": "Pardon me, does this Knight Bus travel to the new shop of books?",
        "946": "Nay, you must disembark at the bank and take the No. 50.",
        "947": "Many thanks. Pray tell, what is the cost of passage to yonder stop?",
        "948": "One Galleon, milady.",
        "949": "How many stops must we endure before arrival?",
        "950": "Two more stops after this one, my friend.",
        "951": "Might I impose upon you to inform me when we shall reach our destination?",
        "952": "Of course, I shall be happy to oblige.",
        "953": "By the way, do I require another transfer after Stop No. 50?",
        "954": "Nay, a No. 50 shall take thee directly to thy desired location.",
        "955": "Thou hast my gratitude.",
        "956": "And how go the preparations for thy nuptials?",
        "957": "Very well, I thank thee. We began organizing everything early to avoid any last-minute rush. The only thing that is yet to be ready is my wedding gown.",
        "958": "When will it be ready, pray?",
        "959": "The dressmakers say that it shall be ready in two fortnights' time.",
        "960": "In three fortnights' time thou art to be wed, so that should be sufficient. Thou hast arranged the church, the feast, the transport, the lodging- all?",
        "961": "Indeed, we have taken care of all. We decided not to be wed in a church, however, as neither of us is particularly devout.",
        "962": "In which inn shall the reception be held?",
        "963": "The Palace Hotel shall be hosting the feast and the wedding cake, I am assured that they shall do a magnificent job.",
        "964": "Ah, yes. 'Tis a most excellent inn. A friend of mine had her reception there and declared it was flawless, though steep in cost.",
        "965": "Indeed, it shall be costly, but we believe it shall be worth it. To know that the preparations for our reception are in the hands of experienced people gives us great comfort.",
        "966": "I believe thou hast made the right choice, my friend.",
        "967": "Hast thou a round-necked jumper?",
        "968": "Indeed. Our collection of jumpers is most extensive.",
        "969": "May I don this one for a try?",
        "970": "Of course, be my guest.",
        "971": "The hue is too bold for my age, I should prefer a lighter shade.",
        "972": "So Dick, shall we procure some coffee this eve?",
        "973": "Coffee? I have not a fondness for that sort of fare.",
        "974": "Come now, thou canst at least give it a try, alongside thy cigarette.",
        "975": "What is wrong with that? Cigarette is my madness.",
        "976": "Not for me, Dick.",
        "977": "Thou art charging me ten galleons for a motion picture I never ordered or viewed.",
        "978": "Allow me to consult your record, sir. It appears thou viewed 'Titanic' on Monday eve.",
        "979": "Well, the record hath an error. I was at a concert on Monday eve.",
        "980": "Thy word outweighs the record, sir. One moment, if you please.",
        "981": "I knew thou wouldst see it my way.",
        "982": "Sir, I have deleted the ten galleons, but I must add a two galleon service charge to thy bill.",
        "983": "Am I in the Twilight Zone? Thou art charging me for a motion picture I never viewed?",
        "984": "Do not hold me accountable, sir. Blame the wizard who wrote the code.",
        "985": "This is robbery on the highway! I shall summon the Aurors!",
        "986": "If it brings thee comfort, other guests have expressed similar sentiments.",
        "987": "Minister Carter has dispatched me to extend an invitation to attend a feast in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel, commencing at 7 PM this eve. Please allow me to present you with this invitation.",
        "988": "How gracious of him. I would be honored to attend. At what hour would you like me to be ready?",
        "989": "If you could have yourself prepared by 6:30 PM, I shall be waiting at the hotel to escort you.",
        "990": "That is wonderful news. Your thoughtfulness is greatly appreciated, Miss Rose.",
        "991": "It is my pleasure. Farewell for now.",
        "992": "Farewell until this evening, Miss Rose.",
        "993": "I desire an audience with Dr. Johnson.",
        "994": "Pardon me, but he is not present at the moment. May I assist you by taking a message?",
        "995": "This is Robert Jordan. Kindly request him to return my call, if you would be so kind.",
        "996": "Very well, I shall deliver the message.",
        "997": "Good day, sir. Might I have a glance at your passport?",
        "998": "Certainly, here you are.",
        "999": "Many thanks. Do these belong to you?",
        "1000": "No, a portion of them belongs to my companion. Would you like me to present her passport as well?",
        "1001": "Indeed, please do. Do you have any hand-carried items?",
        "1002": "Shall I place them on the conveyor belt as well?",
        "1003": "Yes, if you would be so kind. Could you open this large suitcase for me?",
        "1004": "Very well. Just a moment. It contains nothing more than some garments and grooming supplies.",
        "1005": "Understood. Do you have anything to declare?",
        "1006": "I do not believe so.",
        "1007": "Do ye carry any fresh produce, live flora, or fauna with ye?",
        "1008": "Nay, none at all.",
        "1009": "Thank ye kindly. Ye may lock yer suitcase. Here be yer wizarding identification papers.",
        "1010": "Many thanks.",
        "1011": "Greetings. I purchased a garment from China at yer emporium this morn.",
        "1012": "Aye?",
        "1013": "I've acquired it in an overlarge size by accident.",
        "1014": "Oh, did ye now?",
        "1015": "Might ye be able to alter it to a size smaller?",
        "1016": "Indeed, of course. Might ye bring the receipt with ye?",
        "1017": "I'll visit yer establishment later this eve, and may I inquire about yer closing time?",
        "1018": "Our shop shall remain open until 8 bells in the evening, madam. We eagerly anticipate yer arrival.",
        "1019": "The headmaster announces the increase in wages today, aye? What is yer estimation of the amount we shall receive?",
        "1020": "I've no notion. Yer guess is as good as mine.",
        "1021": "It had best be more than last year.",
        "1022": "Indeed, anything is better than naught. Let us wait and see.",
        "1023": "I plan to venture forth and gather provisions for sustenance.",
        "1024": "Pray, do we require provisions?",
        "1025": "I believe we have run out of provisions to sustain us.",
        "1026": "Do ye have a list of items to procure?",
        "1027": "I'm not sure what provisions we require, wizard.",
        "1028": "Might I suggest you go and inspect the larder, wizard?",
        "1029": "I would be most grateful if you would take care of that for me, wizard.",
        "1030": "Why not simply secure the essentials, wizard?",
        "1031": "What do you mean, wizard?",
        "1032": "Eggs, milk, bread, things of that nature, wizard.",
        "1033": "Create that list, wizard.",
        "1034": "Of course, no trouble, wizard.",
        "1035": "Greetings, do take a seat. Let us get straight to business. This is our pact. Please read it thoroughly before affixing your signature.",
        "1036": "As we have reached an understanding on all terms, there should not be any obstacles for the pact.",
        "1037": "Allow me to remind you once more, the pact can be dissolved with a month's notice.",
        "1038": "Yes, I comprehend. Thank you.",
        "1039": "Pardon me, is this the baggage reclaim for flight KL17?",
        "1040": "Yes, how may I assist you?",
        "1041": "This is my baggage tag for reclaim. Might I have my belongings now?",
        "1042": "Very well, here you are.",
        "1043": "Many thanks.",
        "1044": "Did you manage to attend the basketball match on Friday night, wizard?",
        "1045": "I was unable to attend, wizard.",
        "1046": "You missed out, it was quite thrilling, wizard.",
        "1047": "Magical Assistance, is there anything I can cast a spell for you on?",
        "1048": "Yes, I am afraid there are not enough outlets for my wand.",
        "1049": "Well, we have 6 for each chamber.",
        "1050": "Yes, but 4 of them have been cursed. Can you send a wizard to repair them?",
        "1051": "OK, wizard, please wait a moment.",
        "1052": "Why did you stop me?",
        "1053": "Are you aware that you rode through a red stop spell?",
        "1054": "I ran a red stop spell?",
        "1055": "Yes, you did.",
        "1056": "I apologize, but I didn't realize that I did.",
        "1057": "Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down, not speed up?",
        "1058": "I was taught that.",
        "1059": "So, then why did you speed up?",
        "1060": "I don't know what to tell you.",
        "1061": "I'm going to have to issue you a citation.",
        "1062": "I understand.",
        "1063": "Here you go. Don't break wizarding laws again.",
        "1064": "Can I have the roll of enchanted film developed here?",
        "1065": "Certainly, wizard.",
        "1066": "Here is the enchanted film. Can I retrieve my pictures tomorrow?",
        "1067": "Is it so? Who emerged triumphant in the end?",
        "1068": "Our side claimed the victory.",
        "1069": "Alas, I was otherwise occupied that evening. I'm vexed I missed such a thrilling event.",
        "1070": "It was a magnificent match.",
        "1071": "What was the final score?",
        "1072": "Our team emerged victorious with a score of 101-98.",
        "1073": "It sounds as though it was a hard-fought match.",
        "1074": "That's precisely why it was such an unforgettable game.",
        "1075": "I shall certainly be in attendance for the next match.",
        "1076": "Have you ever indulged in online shopping?",
        "1077": "No, never. I prefer to examine what I'm purchasing before I hand over my coin, particularly in regards to garments and footwear.",
        "1078": "Indeed, seeing is believing.",
        "1079": "I've heard some individuals say that the items they receive are not what they expected after seeing them advertised on the internet.",
        "1080": "It's a common occurrence. Without proper inspection, one may fall prey to a scam and the shop may vanish without a trace.",
        "1081": "What's more, paying online poses a risk as Dark Wizards may steal one's username and password.",
        "1082": "I've heard that measures have been put in place to counter such dangers, but I still feel that it's not entirely safe. That's why I prefer shopping in the wizarding world's many shops.",
        "1083": "I couldn't agree more. That's why I only participate in shopping on the streets.",
        "1084": "As do I. I'll sometimes peruse online shops for information, then go to a physical store to complete the transaction.",
        "1085": "A wise course of action.",
        "1086": "How far is it to the center of town from here?",
        "1087": "It's a journey by broomstick that shall take fifteen minutes.",
        "1088": "What sort of wizarding establishments do we have nearby?",
        "1089": "The neighborhood is home to renowned wizarding companies such as Mitsubishi, HP, IBM and many others.",
        "1090": "Is the seventh floor also owned by our wizarding firm?",
        "1091": "Indeed, our wizarding firm has claimed both the sixth and seventh floors of this building as its own.",
        "1092": "Being such a grand firm, do we possess our own staff dining hall?",
        "1093": "Indeed, it can be found at the end of the corridor.",
        "1094": "Good morning, sir. How may I be of assistance?",
        "1095": "Good morning, I have a meeting scheduled with Mr. Johnson at 10:00.",
        "1096": "Forgive me, sir, but are you Mr. Richard of the World Trading Company?",
        "1097": "Indeed, I am.",
        "1098": "Apologies, Mr. Richard. Mr. Johnson is on his way to the office. He's just sent word that he'll be here soon and has asked you to wait a moment.",
        "1099": "Very well, I shall wait.",
        "1100": "May I offer you a drink, sir? Would you prefer coffee or tea?",
        "1101": "Many thanks. I would like coffee, please.",
        "1102": "Here you are, Mr. Richard. This is the cream, and here is the sugar. If there's anything else you require, do not hesitate to ask.",
        "1103": "Much obliged.",
        "1104": "Ministry of Magic emergency services, how may I assist you?",
        "1105": "I must report a break-in.",
        "1106": "At what time did this break-in occur?",
        "1107": "Last night the break-in was reported.",
        "1108": "Where was the home of the victim?",
        "1109": "It was the victim's own home that was broken into.",
        "1110": "Has anything been taken yet?",
        "1111": "The victim is not sure, as of yet.",
        "1112": "What led the victim to suspect a break-in?",
        "1113": "The front window of the victim's home had been shattered.",
        "1114": "A team of Aurors will be dispatched immediately.",
        "1115": "The victim is in need of haste.",
        "1116": "Good day, attendees. Allow me to introduce myself.",
        "1117": "Your introduction is unnecessary, Yang. Your reputation precedes you.",
        "1118": "Thank you, but I still thought I would attempt to chair this meeting in a traditional manner, at least for a while.",
        "1119": "Very well, let us proceed.",
        "1120": "I would like to commence proceedings. Today's primary focus is the creation of a U.S. sales strategy for the latest EBB model. I would like to hear all of your thoughts and suggestions. Mr. Wall, I understand you are particularly well-prepared today. Would you care to start us off?",
        "1121": "Of course, I believe we must keep in mind that effective advertising is the cornerstone of successful sales.",
        "1122": "That much is rather evident, is it not?",
        "1123": "Please be understanding, Yang.",
        "1124": "Shall we continue on with the discussion?",
        "1125": "I apologize, but I do not believe this issue can be attributed to our responsibility.",
        "1126": "Could you please elaborate?",
        "1127": "It appears the delivery service hath committed this deed.",
        "1128": "In that case, we ought to bring this matter to their attention forthwith.",
        "1129": "Greetings, Mr. Johnson. I am pleased thou hast found the time to meet with me. There is no finer setting for our discussion today, the ambiance in this place is delightful.",
        "1130": "Fear not, for I always make it a point to mix business with leisure when the opportunity presents itself. Now, pray tell, what more canst thou tell me about these confections thou art offering?",
        "1131": "Well, as thou art aware, I have recently become the exclusive distributor of Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons throughout the United States. They are a new manufacturer, seeking to make their mark in the luxury market. Thy restaurant immediately came to mind, as I believe it embodies many of the same qualities as Grangers. Adding these chocolates to thy menu shall further establish thy reputation for providing first-class, elegant, and luxurious dining.",
        "1132": "Hmmm, intriguing... Gourmet chocolates, are they produced in Belgium, perchance?",
        "1133": "Nay, the factory is located in Scotland.",
        "1134": "Truly? I was not aware Scotland was renowned for its luxury chocolate production.",
        "1135": "That is precisely what makes this such a remarkable opportunity! The government is fully supportive of creating new markets for exports and hath guaranteed a low tariff for wholesale orders of more than a thousand units. They have also streamlined the customs process. Here, I brought these specifically for thee. Try one!",
        "1136": "Oh, thank thee. Mmm, the texture is creamy, very smooth...",
        "1137": "Unusual, are they not? I wager thou hast never tasted anything like it! The quality is guaranteed, for I personally visit the factory to ensure that no shortcuts are taken with the ingredients. Only the finest make it through my inspection.",
        "1138": "Indeed, the flavors are most intriguing... Slightly spicy, quite unique. Pray tell, what exactly are the ingredients?",
        "1139": "I have it on the utmost authority that this traditional secret recipe hath been passed down through the Granger family for generations. I am confident thou canst keep a secret. Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar, and Haggis.",
        "1140": "Haggis? What is Haggis?",
        "1141": "It is a traditional Scottish delicacy. One stuffs sheep's liver, heart, and lung inside the sheep's stomach.",
        "1142": "Ah, I shall respond anon.",
        "1143": "Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson?",
        "1144": "Dost thou require a guide?",
        "1145": "Aye, we are seeking one. What is the daily fee?",
        "1146": "A mere 20 Galleons a day it is, and if ye plan on stayin' for more than three days in the city, 'twill be 16 Galleons per day.",
        "1147": "That seems fair, wizard.",
        "1148": "Are you not Jim Green, the wizard?",
        "1149": "Yes, I am Jim Green. Verily, it is I.",
        "1150": "I recall our meeting at a wizarding concert last year. I am Taylor, wizard of renown.",
        "1151": "Ah, yes, I remember now. Greetings, Taylor.",
        "1152": "Lucy, I wish to attend to the flickering light in the corridor, which hath been driving me mad. Would thou art willing to aid me with thy ladder?",
        "1153": "Monica, tarry for a moment. I think it would be best to summon a repair wizard to attend to the task.",
        "1154": "I am confident that I can handle it alone.",
        "1155": "I would like thee to peruse the safety manual of our wizarding company.",
        "1156": "I comprehend. If I were to be injured whilst fixing the light, even during office hours, I would not receive compensation from our wizarding company, as repairing is not my responsibility.",
        "1157": "Other wizarding company regulations also require your attention.",
        "1158": "Like this one? Never wear loose robes or untied hair when operating the shredder. Aye, thank thee for thy warning.",
        "1159": "Do not mention it, wizard.",
        "1160": "Huzzah! I have completed writing the service guide! It hath taken me an age!",
        "1161": "When didst thou complete the task?",
        "1162": "This morning! No more overtime, and no more headaches!",
        "1163": "Well, I am glad to hear it. Wouldst thou care for a cup of wizarding coffee?",
        "1164": "I did not receive an unemployment stipend this week and must know the reason why.",
        "1165": "Didst thou send us thy last Continued Claim Form, wizard?",
        "1166": "I fear I may have forgotten to send it in.",
        "1167": "If thou dost not turn in the Continued Claim Form every fortnight, we cannot remunerate thee.",
        "1168": "Can it still be sent by post if it be more than fourteen days late?",
        "1169": "If it be no more than two weeks past due, we shall still accept it.",
        "1170": "I shall make certain to send it sooner next time so as to avoid such issues.",
        "1171": "Thou canst not predict thy work schedule in advance. If thou sendeth it too soon, it shall be rejected!",
        "1172": "Shall my wages arrive belatedly due to my error in the form?",
        "1173": "Thy pay shall arrive late, but the next shall arrive promptly.",
        "1174": "I must inform thee that I shall be departing in thirty minutes' time.",
        "1175": "I am prepared when thou art, sir.",
        "1176": "Excellent! The clock hath just struck nine in New York.",
        "1177": "Thou art correct, sir. Just now it hath become nine o'clock.",
        "1178": "I shall spend some time exploring the city. What should I do with my baggage?",
        "1179": "Here, sir, we have a storage site for thy belongings at the cost of five galleons per hour, but a deposit is required.",
        "1180": "A deposit? Are my belongings not enough of a deposit?",
        "1181": "Apologies, sir, but they are not. Thy MasterCard or VISA shall suffice.",
        "1182": "Very well. I shall consider it.",
        "1183": "Very well, sir, but tarry not too long. Thou hast but thirty minutes.",
        "1184": "May I take thy order?",
        "1185": "Aye, I would like a bowl of onion soup, if thou please.",
        "1186": "And what would thou like after that?",
        "1187": "Pray, I should like the roasted fowl, if you would be so kind.",
        "1188": "It is the latest fashion, particularly amongst the young witches and wizards.",
        "1189": "Indeed, I am aware, and I find it quite charming. I shall partake.",
        "1190": "Very good. Here is your bill, sir or madam.",
        "1191": "Might I inquire as to the length of the guarantee for this communication device?",
        "1192": "You may return it for a full refund within seven days or exchange it for a new one within a year's time.",
        "1193": "Greetings, my love. How was your day today?",
        "1194": "It was passable. I ran into Bill and we chatted for a spell. He seems to have gotten himself into a bit of trouble.",
        "1195": "Oh? What has happened?",
        "1196": "Well, it seems his son has had an unfortunate mishap, and Bill has no medical coverage. This news has made me ponder, and I have begun to wonder if we shouldn't consider the services of a wizarding HMO.",
        "1197": "Indeed, you are correct. We are not getting any younger, and our children will soon be in need of our care.",
        "1198": "Precisely! I scoured the wizarding web and found a few HMOs with reasonable co-payments and excellent coverage. The deductibles are quite low as well.",
        "1199": "That sounds promising, although I do wonder if we shall be eligible for such coverage. The wizarding insurance companies can be quite mercenary.",
        "1200": "Well, as we have no pre-existing conditions or afflictions, I am confident that we shall be accepted.",
        "1201": "It is a shame that our place of employment or our wizarding community do not provide us with proper medical coverage.",
        "1202": "Indeed, not in a million years!",
        "1203": "Greetings. Might you be so kind as to inform me of the steps one must take in order to apply for a position?",
        "1204": "Of course, there are many steps involved. You may submit your application through the wizarding web and then send your curriculum vitae to the company's owl post. Then, you must await their reply.",
        "1205": "Might I ask what qualifications are required for the position?",
        "1206": "You must have a minimum of two years experience in the field.",
        "1207": "What was the outcome of your day's endeavors, my friend?",
        "1208": "I engaged in a game of wizard's poker with my colleagues from the Ministry of Magic.",
        "1209": "Did fortune smile upon you this day?",
        "1210": "Indeed, success was mine.",
        "1211": "I seek to retrieve a portion of my savings stored within my wizarding account.",
        "1212": "Might I request a glimpse of your wizarding ledger and the form for withdrawal, if you please?",
        "1213": "Of course, here you are.",
        "1214": "Let me just verify, you desire to withdraw the sum of one thousand wizarding galleons?",
        "1215": "Precisely so.",
        "1216": "May I inspect that magical camera, if you don't mind?",
        "1217": "Certainly, this is a particularly fine piece of magical technology.",
        "1218": "What is the cost for this device?",
        "1219": "This particular model is valued at 1500 wizarding knuts.",
        "1220": "It appears to be a fine specimen. I believe I shall purchase it.",
        "1221": "Might I interest you in any additional items?",
        "1222": "No, thank you, that shall be all.",
        "1223": "I require a beverage to wash down my meal. Is there any juice available within the refrigerator?",
        "1224": "What is this revolting concoction before me? It appears to have originated from the depths of a bog!",
        "1225": "It is a potion of a green hue, touted to contain numerous vitamins and minerals.",
        "1226": "One needn't sacrifice taste in the pursuit of a healthy diet, my friend.",
        "1227": "The apothecary said that even if I consume the proper potions, I may still not receive the necessary vitamins.",
        "1228": "Have you tested this yourself, or do you simply trust the apothecary's words?",
        "1229": "It is much simpler to drink this tonic once a day, instead of constantly imbibing fruits and vegetables.",
        "1230": "While it may be more expeditious, I'm not so sure about easier. This tonic looks quite unappetizing.",
        "1231": "Billy, tardiness strikes again.",
        "1232": "My apologies for my lateness. I overslept. Is the Headmaster in today?",
        "1233": "Indeed, he is within his office at this moment.",
        "1234": "Oh, I hope he did not observe my arrival.",
        "1235": "Do not take any risks. It would be best if you faced the Headmaster and offered your apologies. He is already displeased with your previous two incidents of tardiness. Any further instances may result in your expulsion.",
        "1236": "You are quite correct. It shall not happen again. Do you truly believe the Headmaster would expel me?",
        "1237": "I fear he might. You should go to his office without delay.",
        "1238": "You are likely correct. I shall go immediately and offer my apologies. It can be quite a challenge to navigate the streets of Hogsmeade, especially during rush hour.",
        "1239": "Good fortune be with you!",
        "1240": "What is the cost of the quarters?",
        "1241": "The monthly rent for the quarters is 1500 galleons.",
        "1242": "And what is the deposit?",
        "1243": "The deposit is a fee of 500 galleons.",
        "1244": "Is there anything else, aside from the credit ranking and debt-to-asset ratio?",
        "1245": "One must also take into account the balance of net liabilities. It must not surpass the net assets, and there can be no recorded losses in the business in the past two years.",
        "1246": "Understood. This should not present an issue.",
        "1247": "The rate of return on assets must not fall below the average for the industry during the first half of the year.",
        "1248": "As far as I can tell, we meet the criteria.",
        "1249": "Of course, we must provide proof and duplicate copies of all necessary documents. Once we've presented the evidence, the assessment should proceed quickly.",
        "1250": "Do you know any languages besides English?",
        "1251": "I have a limited understanding of Japanese, which shares many similarities with Chinese culture and language.",
        "1252": "What level did you attain on the Japanese Language Proficiency Test?",
        "1253": "I achieved Band 2 on the test, but I hope to reach the highest level, Band 1, in the future.",
        "1254": "What seems to be the issue, Mr. Brown?",
        "1255": "I'm not feeling well, Doctor Ford.",
        "1256": "In what way?",
        "1257": "I've lost my appetite, always tired, and have trouble sleeping.",
        "1258": "Have you lost weight?",
        "1259": "Yes, I've lost quite a bit of weight over the past month.",
        "1260": "When was the last time you were checked by a doctor?",
        "1261": "About two months ago.",
        "1262": "Let me take your blood pressure. You appear pale. Don't worry, Mr. Brown, it's nothing serious. You're just a bit run down from overworking.",
        "1263": "What should I do?",
        "1264": "A vacation would likely do you good. Try to get outside more and get some rest. That should help.",
        "1265": "Thank you, Doctor. I'll follow your advice.",
        "1266": "May I see your wizarding passport, please?",
        "1267": "Aye, I can.",
        "1268": "Additionally, I would like two copies of each of the spell-stills.",
        "1269": "Do tell me about yourself, if you please.",
        "1270": "My name is Dunlin and I hail from Beijing. I was born in the year of the dragon, 1980. I shall be graduating from Peking University this July, with a specialization in the art of accounting.",
        "1271": "Might you also share some details about your kin?",
        "1272": "I come from a small family of three, myself, my father who is a professor of magic, and my mother who is a skilled artisan.",
        "1273": "It is high time I start nourishing myself with wholesome ingredients.",
        "1274": "Aye, 'tis true. I too must start making better choices in my meals.",
        "1275": "What manner of food do you typically partake in?",
        "1276": "I do my utmost to only consume fruits, vegetables, and lean cuts of enchanted chicken.",
        "1277": "Is that truly all that goes into your cauldron?",
        "1278": "Indeed, for the most part.",
        "1279": "How do you manage to stick to such a limited diet?",
        "1280": "Fruits, vegetables, and magical creatures such as chicken, are known to be highly nutritious and beneficial to the body and soul.",
        "1281": "Aye, but what of the enchanted chicken?",
        "1282": "I mostly consume baked chicken, as it is prepared in a manner that retains its nutritional properties and is relatively low in unhealthy substances.",
        "1283": "That does sound rather palatable.",
        "1284": "Indeed it does, for it is both wholesome and satisfying.",
        "1285": "Good day to you! Might I be of assistance?",
        "1286": "Would you be so kind as to direct me to the aisle housing the robes of the Chinese persuasion? I am in search of a silken cloak.",
        "1287": "Of course, here is my passport.",
        "1288": "I take it you are here for the German delegation's business, correct?",
        "1289": "Indeed, I was invited by a German company for some business discussions.",
        "1290": "For how long will you be residing in our fair land?",
        "1291": "Just for two weeks, nothing too long.",
        "1292": "How many pieces of luggage have you brought with you?",
        "1293": "Just one, my trusty camera.",
        "1294": "Do you have plans to remove it upon your departure?",
        "1295": "I do, indeed.",
        "1296": "Per the regulations, your camera is allowed to stay with you during your time here duty-free, but it must be removed upon leaving our country.",
        "1297": "I shall comply with these regulations.",
        "1298": "Well then, may your stay in Germany be filled with pleasant experiences.",
        "1299": "My thanks to you.",
        "1300": "Excuse me, what should I include in my Curriculum Vitae?",
        "1301": "Typically, a CV or resume should include six elements: personal information, educational background, practical experience, personal skills, self-evaluation, and career aspirations.",
        "1302": "What kind of personal information is required?",
        "1303": "Such information as your name, gender, date of birth, height, and contact information, among others.",
        "1304": "May I enter?",
        "1305": "Indeed, come in. I am the Director of Personnel, Mr. Peter. How may I assist you?",
        "1306": "It is a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Peter. I am Wang Sian, and I am here for the interview as previously arranged.",
        "1307": "Greetings, Miss Wang. How do you fare this fine day? Please, do have a seat.",
        "1308": "Many thanks.",
        "1309": "In which subject did you specialize during your education, if I may inquire?",
        "1310": "I studied Public Relations at the wizarding school of my choice.",
        "1311": "Have you put your education to use in the work world?",
        "1312": "Indeed I have, sir. After graduation, I spent a year working in the export section of a trade company located in the wizarding city of Macao.",
        "1313": "What sorts of duties were you responsible for in that position?",
        "1314": "My responsibilities included overseeing the successful export of various wizarding goods and products.",
        "1315": "Fascinating, you must have a good understanding of the complexities of export procedures.",
        "1316": "Indeed, I do, sir.",
        "1317": "Splendid. That will certainly come in useful.",
        "1318": "Where to, madam?",
        "1319": "To the Grand Hotel, if you please.",
        "1320": "The Grand Hotel, you say?",
        "1321": "Correct, do you know its location?",
        "1322": "I'm afraid not, madam. I do not believe I am familiar with its location.",
        "1323": "It can be found on 11th Avenue, at the end of Park Street.",
        "1324": "Ah, yes! I know the location well now.",
        "1325": "Might I take your order now, madam?",
        "1326": "Indeed, I'll start with a serving of the shrimp cocktail, if you please.",
        "1327": "What would you like for your main course, wizard?",
        "1328": "I'll have a steak, medium rare, please.",
        "1329": "Do you have any reading material, wizard?",
        "1330": "Yes, I do have some.",
        "1331": "Could I borrow one, wizard?",
        "1332": "Of course, here you go.",
        "1333": "Thank you. It's quite chilly this morning, isn't it?",
        "1334": "You're not wrong there.",
        "1335": "Have you heard any news, wizard?",
        "1336": "Which news are you referring to?",
        "1337": "Brazil won the World Cup.",
        "1338": "I see, indeed.",
        "1339": "We have an orientation this afternoon.",
        "1340": "What will be covered during the orientation?",
        "1341": "The company introduction, our mission and vision, various policies, insurance, pension plan, company ID, batch, telephone, email set-up, and training.",
        "1342": "That's quite a lot. All of that in one afternoon?",
        "1343": "Yes, it won't be easy.",
        "1344": "I'm OK with it. I like being busy and learning new things.",
        "1345": "Excuse me, wizard, could you please guide me to the human resources department?",
        "1346": "Of course, but have you made an appointment beforehand?",
        "1347": "Greetings, I am Monica. I have an appointment with your HR manager.",
        "1348": "One moment, if you please. I shall make a call to the HR office. Yes, they confirm your appointment. Please come in. The HR department is located on the 3rd floor, room 3106. You may take the right elevator, as the left one is undergoing maintenance today.",
        "1349": "Many thanks.",
        "1350": "You're quite welcome.",
        "1351": "When shall we expect the finished product from you?",
        "1352": "We anticipate having it completed by the end of next week.",
        "1353": "Fantastic! That will be ahead of schedule. Well done!",
        "1354": "Indeed, as the saying goes, we strive to exceed expectations.",
        "1355": "Do you happen to have any cheaper alternatives?",
        "1356": "Yes, we have a few options on special sale at present.",
        "1357": "That's much more reasonable. I'll take this one, then.",
        "1358": "Good morning, how may I assist you today?",
        "1359": "I am searching for a pair of earrings to give to my wife as an anniversary gift.",
        "1360": "You have come to the correct establishment. We have a magnificent array of earrings for you to select from.",
        "1361": "I noticed a pair of earrings in your window display. Might I have a closer look?",
        "1362": "Do you refer to the dazzling pearl earrings?",
        "1363": "Indeed, how much are they?",
        "1364": "They are priced at three thousand yuan.",
        "1365": "What is the setting made of?",
        "1366": "The setting, sir, is crafted from a unique platinum alloy, ensuring its luster will never fade.",
        "1367": "By Merlin's beard, I shall take them. Please package them and provide me with the parchment.",
        "1368": "A wise decision, sir. An excellent choice.",
        "1369": "Room service, I say!",
        "1370": "Good morning, 'tis room 113 speaking. I require breakfast, pronto.",
        "1371": "Very good, Mrs. Jones?",
        "1372": "That is correct.",
        "1373": "How can I be of assistance?",
        "1374": "I would like a goblet of grapefruit juice, a jar of marmalade, a plate of scrambled eggs and sausages, a loaf of toast, and a cauldron of black coffee, if you please. How long until it arrives?",
        "1375": "Only a matter of moments, madam.",
        "1376": "Marvelous, I am grateful.",
        "1377": "Greetings, Sam. I seek to purchase a companion. Have you any suggestions?",
        "1378": "Rachel's pet emporium is where you should go.",
        "1379": "And why is that, pray tell?",
        "1380": "It's beyond special. One may find any manner of creature they can think to name, and more.",
        "1381": "Is that so? Are there serpents within?",
        "1382": "Serpents? Ha! There are even rodents and primates! A world of exotic creatures to choose from.",
        "1383": "Fantastic, I cannot wait to visit.",
        "1384": "Wait, are you certain that you wish to keep a non-traditional companion?",
        "1385": "Why not? 'Tis quite cool.",
        "1386": "But it may pose a hazard to your health, friend.",
        "1387": "Excuse me?",
        "1388": "Many reptiles carry potentially dangerous bacteria that may pose a risk to one's health.",
        "1389": "Ah, I was not aware of that.",
        "1390": "It might not be the safest option for families, especially those with young children, to keep such pets.",
        "1391": "Oh, I hadn't thought about my brother's infant daughter. Perhaps a canine companion would be a better fit for me.",
        "1392": "Good luck in your decision, Maria.",
        "1393": "Greetings, this is room 1205. Our message light is flashing.",
        "1394": "One moment, if you please.",
        "1395": "Many thanks.",
        "1396": "I apologize for the delay. Mr. Johns requires a call from you.",
        "1397": "Might you bring the message to my quarters?",
        "1398": "Unfortunately, we have no available messenger at present.",
        "1399": "Then I shall come down and retrieve the message posthaste.",
        "1400": "Understood, we shall be waiting for you.",
        "1401": "Care to hazard a guess? I've received some exciting news!",
        "1402": "Pray tell, what is it?",
        "1403": "As you are aware, I've been working as a proof-reader at The Economist, correct?",
        "1404": "Indeed.",
        "1405": "The editor-in-chief took note of my previous experience as an editor at another publication and has offered me the position of assistant editor.",
        "1406": "Really? How wonderful! Will you have the opportunity to put quill to parchment?",
        "1407": "She announced that the scribe of the literary commentary would soon be departing on a maternity leave, and that I might take up the quill until her return.",
        "1408": "Wow! That is indeed news to be celebrated. How often does the periodical see print?",
        "1409": "It's a monthly publication, yet I must share the space with another scribe, so I must pen my articles bi-weekly.",
        "1410": "Are you eager to delve deeper into the editing work?",
        "1411": "Indeed, but my excitement is greater still at the prospect of having my musings published once more!",
        "1412": "Do you have any parchment to order a subscription to the magazine?",
        "1413": "Alas, I do not, but I believe I might be able to bring a complimentary copy home for you.",
        "1414": "I eagerly anticipate reading your commentary.",
        "1415": "As do I. Shall we go out to celebrate this good news?",
        "1416": "Of course, where might you suggest we go?",
        "1417": "Perhaps we could attend the library festival that is being held at the local bookseller's?",
        "1418": "Have you seen the new issue of Cosmo that I perused this morn?",
        "1419": "I believe I did spy it upon the kitchen table.",
        "1420": "Indeed, my thanks. There is an intriguing interview with a prominent director regarding his latest motion picture that I must finish reading.",
        "1421": "And who is this director?",
        "1422": "It is none other than Martin Scorsese. Did you not enjoy his film, 'The Departed'?",
        "1423": "I did, it was grand! Might I read the interview when you have finished?",
        "1424": "Of course. You know, it is also available in the online edition. If you are eager to read it now, you might peruse it there.",
        "1425": "That is kind, but I shall wait. Out of curiosity, do you subscribe to this periodical?",
        "1426": "No, I do not. I do not frequent it enough for a subscription to be justified.",
        "1427": "How much does The Daily Prophet cost?",
        "1428": "It's nearly three Galleons now, and I've heard whispers that the price may be raised to four Galleons soon.",
        "1429": "That seems quite steep. Who is their target audience?",
        "1430": "The Daily Prophet primarily caters to the wizarding middle class, though I fear that if the price rises too much, their circulation will drop significantly.",
        "1431": "I'll wager that you'll still purchase it, though. You couldn't possibly be without your wizarding news and gossip!",
        "1432": "Ha! This is a rare occasion indeed, you've not haggled!",
        "1433": "Haggle? I wouldn't want to feel guilty for trying to save a few Sickles.",
        "1434": "But you could have saved some money.",
        "1435": "For what? A few sickles? No, it's not worth it. Plus, I'd happily pay more for access to the latest wizarding news and events.",
        "1436": "For your information, there is a magical market nearby. But perhaps you're done shopping for the day...",
        "1437": "Ha! I've only just begun! Please take me there at once!",
        "1438": "Can you assist me in conducting a wizarding search?",
        "1439": "Of course. What would you like to find?",
        "1440": "I wish to learn more about the First Wizarding War.",
        "1441": "Ah, might I ask for a bit more specificity? There are many records and accounts of that war.",
        "1442": "Yes, I would like to know more about the Battle of Hogwarts.",
        "1443": "Very well. You may use the Wizarding Wireless Network, simply type in 'Battle of Hogwarts.'",
        "1444": "My word, there are a multitude of results.",
        "1445": "Here, try this one. It's a reliable source of information about the Battle of Hogwarts.",
        "1446": "Thank you.",
        "1447": "For a more comprehensive understanding, I suggest perusing a historical tome.",
        "1448": "Many thanks. I shall visit the wizarding library if I desire to know more.",
        "1449": "I must take a brief respite from my studies. I have been cooped up within these walls for too long.",
        "1450": "Understood. Please do return in two hours' time.",
        "1451": "Good day. I seek an audience with Tom Smith.",
        "1452": "I'm afraid he is unavailable at his desk at the moment.",
        "1453": "Do you have a notion of when he will return?",
        "1454": "Tom is away on a wizarding business journey and shall not return until sometime next week.",
        "1455": "Is there a means by which I may contact him?",
        "1456": "The best way to reach him would be through his wand. Let me give you his number.",
        "1457": "Thank you. Might I also inquire about his owl post address, just in case?",
        "1458": "Of course. His wand number is 09112223 33, and his owl post address is t.smith@ccw.com.tw.",
        "1459": "Thank you so kindly. Does he regularly check his correspondence?",
        "1460": "Indeed, he is quite prompt in responding to his messages.",
        "1461": "Splendid. Thank you once again for your assistance. You have been most helpful.",
        "1462": "It was my pleasure. I hope you are able to reach him.",
        "1463": "Pray tell, what seems to be the matter, Mr. Brown?",
        "1464": "I am not well, Dr. Ford. I am in a sorry state.",
        "1465": "Oh, in what way do you feel unwell?",
        "1466": "I have lost my appetite, feel constantly uneasy, and cannot sleep properly.",
        "1467": "Hast thou shed any pounds, my friend?",
        "1468": "Aye, I have indeed dropped a fair number of stones since last moon.",
        "1469": "When was the last time thou visited the healer?",
        "1470": "It was two moons past.",
        "1471": "Allow me to take thy blood pressure. Thou dost appear pale.",
        "1472": "Fear not, Mr. Brown, 'tis nothing of great concern.",
        "1473": "Thou art simply a bit worn out from over exertion.",
        "1474": "What am I to do, healer?",
        "1475": "A holiday would do thee wonders, I believe.",
        "1476": "Try to spend more time in the open air and ensure thou get enough rest.",
        "1477": "Thank thee, healer. I shall follow thy advice.",
        "1478": "Good morrow, Angela. How hast thou been of late?",
        "1479": "Mornin', Michael. I have been most busy as of late. One of our suppliers is closing shop, and I have been searching for a worthy replacement.",
        "1480": "Fear not, Angela. Thou canst always count on us to be here for the long haul. Care for a seat and a cuppa?",
        "1481": "Nay, thank thee. I have been trying to cut down on the caffeine.",
        "1482": "Ha, I could never do that. I would be a zombie without my morning coffee. Let us then get down to business.",
        "1483": "Aye. I have come to discuss the ordering of eight megapixel cameras for our new methone. The demand for such devices is growing, and Pear has fallen behind in the market.",
        "1484": "Marvelous news! I am glad Pear has finally joined the fray. Currently, our agreement is for five megapixel cameras. Is Pear still interested in obtaining such devices?",
        "1485": "Nay, we have changed all cameras to eight megapixels. We had hoped that by making thy company our sole supplier for cameras, we could negotiate a better agreement."

        "63": "That sounds great! I was wondering if I could get both life and health insurance.",
        "64": "Sure thing! You'll get 2 weeks of paid vacation each year and a 5-day workweek.",
        "65": "Perfect. Is there anything else included?",
        "66": "Yes, all your insurance will be tied to your work. We'll also provide you with an enchanted insurance policy.",
        "67": "Next up, how may I assist you, wizard?",
        "68": "I'd like to send a registered airmail letter to France, please.",
        "69": "Got it, that will be 4 dollars and 20 cents.",
        "70": "Here's 5 dollars.",
        "71": "Here's your change. You will receive a receipt of the registered mail soon.",
        "72": "Oh, and I also need to send this package. This is the note for it.",
        "73": "Let me take a look... just a moment. Here it is. I'll need you to sign this note.",
        "74": "And one more thing, where can I mail this letter?",
        "75": "Just drop it in the out of town mailbox at that corner.",
        "76": "Thanks a lot!",
        "77": "You're welcome, wizard. It was a pleasure assisting you.",
        "78": "Wow, we were really lucky. We got the last available table for two without even having a reservation! Did you see the long line of people behind us?",
        "79": "Aye, I'm grateful we didn't have to wait long. I'm famished!",
        "80": "Let's take a gander at the menu so we can place our order. Shall we choose an hors d'oeuvre to share?",
        "81": "Which would you prefer, samosas or poppadoms?",
        "82": "I've heard that their samosas are a specialty dish.",
        "83": "Very well, let's order a platter of those then.",
        "84": "Sounds grand. What will you be having for your main course?",
        "85": "I'm considering a Dahl.",
        "86": "What exactly is in a Dahl?",
        "87": "It's got chickpeas and vegetables in a fiery curry sauce served with rice.",
        "88": "That sounds quite delectable. Would you like to share some kebabs as well?",
        "89": "Agreed. How about some lamb kebabs?",
        "90": "That's my favorite. Would you care for a glass of wine or a mug of brew?",
        "91": "I think I'll have a mug of brew.",
        "92": "Understood, shall I wave down the barmaid?",
        "93": "I wouldn't advise it. Perhaps it's best to wait until she comes 'round.",
        "94": "You're right. That could be considered rude. It's a good thing you're here with me!",
        "95": "What would I do without you?",
        "96": "This position requires a certain level of writing aptitude, so please elaborate on your writing ability.",
        "97": "Of course. I've had a passion for writing since I was a young wizard. I won first prize in a national composition contest whilst I was in middle school. After attending the wizarding university, I never ceased to write. My works, such as 'Father's Tobacco Pipe', 'Open Air Cinema', and 'The Old City', were published in the Daily Prophet, The Wizarding Times, and the New Wizarding Gazette, respectively. During my studies for my master's and doctorate, I focused on developing my research skills and published several papers. 'The Impact of Magic on Political Participation', 'The Discipline of Remold', 'The Historical Direction of Wizarding Administration Reform', and 'Bribery Cases of Self-Governance in Wizarding Villages' were published in the Wizarding Administration Quarterly, The Wizarding Journal of Duelling, Theory and Magic, and the Wizarding Reform Magazine, respectively. I began working as a freelance journalist for The Wizarding Times in 2006. During this time, I wrote numerous articles, which greatly improved my writing ability. I am confident in my writing ability and believe I am well suited for and I believe I can do the job well .",
        "98": "pompous . How may I help you ?",
        "99": "Yes, I'd like to reserve a table for dinner in the Grand Hall of Wizardry.",
        "100": "How many in your coven are you expecting?",
        "101": "Six duos of powerful wizards.",
        "102": "Would you like to reserve a private wizarding room for your dinner?",
        "103": "That sounds like a wise decision.",
        "104": "Very well. May I have your name, wizard?",
        "105": "I am Ron Kollwitz, Master of the Arcane.",
        "106": "Ms. Wang, allow me to introduce you to Mr. Cooper, President of the Ivy Publishing Coven.",
        "107": "It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mr. Cooper.",
        "108": "The pleasure is mine, Ms. Wang. I understand that your journey from the frozen north was a long one.",
        "109": "Yes, it was quite a journey. I am grateful to finally have arrived here in the wizarding realm.",
        "110": "Can you assist me now with your magic?",
        "111": "Regrettably, I am unable to aid you this evening. However, I shall be at your service tomorrow.",
        "112": "Alas, that will be too late for my needs.",
        "113": "Why not seek the assistance of Bill, the wizard of the hour?",
        "114": "I have already approached him, but unfortunately he was unable to assist me.",
        "115": "Do you possess any experience in the art of advertising?",
        "116": "Indeed, I have spent the past two years as the public relations wizard for a powerful company. I crafted the advertising spells and collaborated with artists and scribes. On occasion, I was required to perform the duties of a specialist in times of dire need.",
        "117": "Have you honed your skills as a wizardly secretary?",
        "118": "Yes, sir. I served as a secretary in a magical insurance firm.",
        "119": "Greeting, may I inquire about the most important traits that a scribe ought to possess?",
        "120": "Indeed, let me ponder. Firstly, I'd say she must be hardworking and proactive. Furthermore, she must be skilled in writing reports and taking notes in shorthand, and possess the ability to record minutes in meetings and the like. Above all, she must have a remarkable memory.",
        "121": "Excuse me, have you had any experience in the usage of magical computers?",
        "122": "Yes, I have undergone training in computer magic and can process information efficiently.",
        "123": "Well done. Might I inquire about your proficiency in the use of communication spells such as Fax and Duplicator?",
        "124": "I assure you, handling such spells poses no difficulty for me.",
        "125": "Pray, what have you learned from previous employment experiences?",
        "126": "Above all, I have learned that the success of the company is tied to my own. Thus, I follow instructions rigorously and ensure that my superior is always informed of my actions.",
        "127": "Well said.",
        "128": "Greetings, Dan. What news have you?",
        "129": "Where have you been? I've been attempting to reach you for the past two days.",
        "130": "I was on a business trip to Salt Lake City. What brings you to seek me?",
        "131": "I was dismissed from my position.",
        "132": "How so? The last I heard, you were quite content with your job and even considered making it a lifelong pursuit. Why this sudden change?",
        "133": "It's a lengthy tale. In short, I failed to perform my duties satisfactorily and made a costly mistake in a business deal worth ten million Galleons.",
        "134": "And what do you plan to do now?",
        "135": "I am searching for a new position as quickly as I can. Lily is unaware of my situation and I have been lying to her about my whereabouts for the past three days, claiming that I was at work as usual.",
        "136": "That is not the best approach. Have you consulted the classified advertisements in the Daily Prophet?",
        "137": "Yes, I have, but my qualifications did not match the requirements of most of the positions I was interested in.",
        "138": "Fear not. I shall see what I can do. In the meantime, you should return home and inform Lily of your situation. She is your wife, after all, and I am sure she will understand.",
        "139": "I simply cannot seem to find the words to broach the topic. Very well, she has the right to know, after all.",
        "140": "Have you ever received a summons from the Ministry of Magic for an illegal park?",
        "141": "I've never had the misfortune. And you, have you?",
        "142": "Alas, I received one just yesterday.",
        "143": "Truly? For what reason?",
        "144": "I dared to park in a restricted zone.",
        "145": "Why did you take such a risk?",
        "146": "I had to attend to a pressing matter with haste.",
        "147": "Where did you park your broomstick?",
        "148": "At my wizarding dwelling, of course.",
        "149": "Do you not have a designated parking space of your own?",
        "150": "Time was of the essence, you see.",
        "151": "That was quite careless of you.",
        "152": "How may I assist you?",
        "153": "I am having a bit of a predicament.",
        "154": "What sort of predicament are you facing?",
        "155": "There have been strange charges made to my Gringotts debit card that I did not authorize.",
        "156": "Do you have your bank statement at hand?",
        "157": "Here it is, as requested.",
        "158": "To which charges are you referring?",
        "159": "Behold, the final four charges written upon the page.",
        "160": "I regret to inform you, but a thorough investigation is required for these charges.",
        "161": "How long shall the investigation be, may I ask?",
        "162": "I'm uncertain, but I can assure you, the payment on these charges will be frozen in the meantime.",
        "163": "That is certainly splendid news.",
        "164": "Greetings, may I assist you in some manner?",
        "165": "That is what I am unsure of. Can I purchase Treasury Scrolls at this counter, perchance?",
        "166": "Indeed, we offer Treasury Parchments with terms of two, three and five years at your disposal.",
        "167": "Two years will suffice, with a worth of 1000 RIB.",
        "168": "Very well, could you present me with identification such as your wizarding passport?",
        "169": "Here you are. May I inquire, can these parchments be redeemed before the term's end?",
        "170": "I am afraid that is not possible. The parchments must reach maturity before they can be cashed in.",
        "171": "Listen here! Why have you taken that gold? You are a scoundrel and a cheat! I should send you straight to Azkaban!",
        "172": "I assure you, I am not cheating. When you reach 'Go' you collect 200 galleons, everyone knows the rules!",
        "173": "You cannot simply take the gold. You must seek approval from Gringotts Bank and I, as the Banker, am in charge.",
        "174": "Banker?",
        "175": "Yes, that is correct.",
        "176": "May I please have my 200 galleons?",
        "177": "Of course. Here you are, 200 galleons. Thank you for your patronage, please visit us again! Now, it is my turn to cast the dice.",
        "178": "Salutations, is this the office of Professor Clark?",
        "179": "Greetings, this is Professor Albus speaking.",
        "180": "Hello, this is Kalina of Gryffindor, from your morning divination course.",
        "181": "Ah, yes, what brings you to call on this occasion?",
        "182": "Regrettably, I had an unfortunate broomstick mishap over the weekend, and will be unable to attend classes today.",
        "183": "Merlin's beard! Are you well?",
        "184": "I've sustained a broken wand arm, but it's mending nicely.",
        "185": "For how long will you be away from lessons?",
        "186": "I expect to be back in the halls of Hogwarts by next week's full moon.",
        "187": "Very well. Thank you for letting me know and I hope you recover promptly.",
        "188": "Salutations! Did you request the assistance of a house-elf?",
        "189": "Indeed I did. Please come in! I'm so relieved you're here! This aging wizarding abode is in dire need of repair. Follow me to the bathroom, you'll see, there's a leak from the ceiling.",
        "190": "Ah, I understand. Allow me to inspect the situation. It appears the blockage is caused by a clogged lavatory. My trusty wand-plunger doesn't seem to be doing the trick. I suspect there may be an object foreign to the pipes causing the issue.",
        "191": "Oh dear, that might be the doing of my young witch, who's apt to dispose of things in peculiar places. You know how young magical folk can be.",
        "192": "Indeed, I have a young wizardling of my own. Nonetheless, these pipes have seen better days and are in dire need of replacement. Neglecting to do so may lead to further problems down the road. I'd also recommend repairing this faucet that won't cease flowing. If urgency permits, I can have it all taken care of by tonight.",
        "193": "That would be most appreciated! Might I inquire as to the cost?",
        "194": "Let's see... I would estimate the fee to be around 800 galleons.",
        "195": "Listen, Karen, I require your aid. I am still new to these lands.",
        "196": "I'd be honored to help. How may I be of service?",
        "197": "My mother-in-law has taken ill and has been admitted to the hospital in Los Angeles. My husband and I will be departing for there tonight by Portkey.",
        "198": "My sincerest sympathies. What seems to be the matter?",
        "199": "The Healers are uncertain as of now. But Suzy is the real concern. She has taken ill with a severe cold, and we cannot bring her along with us on our journey. Yet we have not found anyone who can stay behind and tend to her.",
        "200": "You require a caretaker for her.",
        "201": "Indeed. I had thought to ask Jill, the lass I have employed previously. However, this time I require someone to watch over Suzy through the night, perhaps even for two nights.",
        "202": "I could house Suzy at my dwelling.",
        "203": "That would be a burden, Karen. I would not wish to impose upon you.",
        "204": "Why ever not?",
        "205": "Your own offspring would be at risk of contracting Suzy's cold. I think it would be best to seek the services of a competent caretaker. Yet I do not know of anyone who would be suitable. I am looking for someone more mature than Jill, someone who could look after Suzy for two or even three days.",
        "206": "I know of someone who can help. There is a young woman by the name of Sara Ralston. She is of age 17, and is often willing to take on such tasks. I am familiar with her from my wizarding community, and I trust her implicitly.",
        "207": "I would like to discuss this with her. I am aware that this is a short notice, but Hank and I must leave this evening.",
        "208": "Allow me to retrieve her contact information for you. I have no doubt that she will be available, she is a highly responsible individual.",
        "209": "I am relieved that you know someone who can assist us. I knew I could count on you for advice in this matter. I would not wish to offend Jill or her mother, and while I believe that Jill could handle the task, I would feel more comfortable with someone of a more advanced age.",
        "210": "I shall return to my abode and obtain Sara's contact information. I will contact her first to gauge her availability.",
        "211": "Excellent. Do inform me once you have spoken with her.",
        "212": "Greetings. What can I get for you?",
        "213": "A pint of ale, if you would be so kind. What sorts of ale do you have on tap?",
        "214": "We have both draft and canned ales available. Which would you prefer?",
        "215": "A draft ale, if you please.",
        "216": "Very well. Here you are.",
        "217": "Might I also have a fruit platter?",
        "218": "Of course. Please give me a moment to prepare it for you.",
        "219": "Greetings, Professor Black, how are you doing today?",
        "220": "Just fine, thank you. And yourself?",
        "221": "Very well, thank you for asking. It's great to see you again. I do apologize for not being able to meet you at the Floo Network, I was occupied with a matter of great importance yesterday. I hope your journey from Hogsmeade was pleasant.",
        "222": "Indeed it was, quite delightful. Thank you.",
        "223": "How is business treating you in the wizarding world?",
        "224": "It's going well, but the market for dragon hide has been slow lately. However, the selling season is just around the corner, and I am hopeful that there will be more customers this year.",
        "225": "I look forward to expanding our business together. Although our past transactions have been satisfactory, there's always room for growth. Let's explore other areas of cooperation such as investment, spell casting, and magical assistance.",
        "226": "Pardon me, could you direct me to the lavatory?",
        "227": "I apologize, but the facilities are currently occupied. The restrooms are located at the back of the shop.",
        "228": "Ah, the perils of public restrooms. Thank you for your assistance, miss.",
        "229": "You're welcome, have a great day.",
        "230": "Excuse me, do you happen to know where I can purchase some bubble wrap and send a parcel?",
        "231": "Yes, you can buy the bubble wrap here, but you'll need to queue over here to send your package.",
        "232": "That line does seem quite long. How long do you estimate the wait to be?",
        "233": "It takes about three minutes per person, so it should take about an hour to reach the front.",
        "234": "Can I purchase some postage stamps here as well?",
        "235": "Of course! How many would you like?",
        "236": "I need thirty for my holiday cards.",
        "237": "Are they being sent abroad?",
        "238": "Yes, twenty of them will be making their way to China and America.",
        "239": "I do not seek to lead, but rather to cooperate with all and achieve our task through the collective effort of us all.",
        "240": "Do you think you can communicate effectively in the tongue of English?",
        "241": "Indeed, for the most part.",
        "242": "Are you open to travel?",
        "243": "Aye, I have a fondness for journeys. I am young and unattached, it is of no hindrance for me to traverse frequently.",
        "244": "How long shall it take us to reach London by carriage?",
        "245": "It is my understanding that the distance to London is 180 kilometers from here. At a brisk pace on the highway, the trip should take no more than two hours.",
        "246": "Of course, unless there are delays from heavy traffic. In that case, it may take us three hours.",
        "247": "Indeed, we may travel at a quick pace at the beginning and end of our journey as we navigate through populated areas.",
        "248": "Shall we allow three hours then to account for any unexpected events?",
        "249": "Ah, have you seen the conveyance provided by my employer?",
        "250": "No, let me take a gander... it appears to be longer than my own mode of transportation.",
        "251": "If memory serves, it is over five meters in length. I cannot recall the exact measurement. It is capable of reaching speeds greater than 200 kilometers per hour.",
        "252": "Merlin's beard! That is swift indeed! I highly doubt we shall attain such velocities on the highway.",
        "253": "Indeed, for to do so would be to break the imposed limits on speed.",
        "254": "And how did I fare on my driving exam?",
        "255": "Do you wish to hear the truth?",
        "256": "Of course, I do.",
        "257": "Well, I must say, your performance was not particularly impressive.",
        "258": "How poorly did I fare?",
        "259": "Hey there, do you have any wizardly spells that can send these cards to the EU? They tend to be less expensive that way.",
        "260": "Nope, sorry.",
        "261": "Alright, here you go. That'll be 18 gold coins and 72 silver pieces.",
        "262": "And the bubble wrap?",
        "263": "That's one more gold coin, friend.",
        "264": "Awesome, thanks a ton. You've been a great help.",
        "265": "Good evening, Saliva. What's that magical scent coming from your kitchen? What're you up to?",
        "266": "Cooking up a storm!",
        "267": "Are you skilled in the culinary arts?",
        "268": "I just graduated from a wizardly cooking academy! I'm planning on opening up a restaurant, so I've been putting my skills to the test.",
        "269": "What a fantastic idea! What are you whipping up at the moment?",
        "270": "I'm using my magic to steam some fish in a pressure cauldron. Have you ever tried steamed fish?",
        "271": "I have, but I must say the one I had at that particular eatery was not exactly appetizing. The fish was undercooked and a bit too salty.",
        "272": "Yeah, I know what you mean. I think the chef didn't allocate enough time for steaming and used too much of a certain herb.",
        "273": "I agree. But let's not dwell on that, shall we? Please give this one a try.",
        "274": "Thank you! Mmm, this is delicious!",
        "275": "Glad you like it! Your approval means a lot to me.",
        "276": "Aside from steamed fish, what other dishes are you skilled in?",
        "277": "I'm quite talented in creating dishes such as beef stew with potatoes, fried chicken, hot and sour soup, and the like.",
        "278": "Next Friday week is my wizarding birthday and I would love to invite you to cook a magical feast for my dinner party, would you be willing?",
        "279": "Why not? It would be a spellbinding opportunity for me to put my culinary magic to the test.",
        "280": "Many thanks, wizard.",
        "281": "It's my pleasure, fellow mage.",
        "282": "Wizarding Room Service. How may I assist you?",
        "283": "This is room 2012. Where is my enchanted laundry? You promised to have it delivered this morning.",
        "284": "Let me check for you. I am sorry, my lord. It seems that your order was mistaken as a standard one. Was it an express laundry you requested?",
        "285": "Indeed, I require the express enchantment.",
        "286": "My lord, we are deeply apologetic for the inconvenience. We will refund the charge and have your enchanted laundry delivered to your room within 3 hours. Does that suit?",
        "287": "That will do, thank you.",
        "288": "Pardon me, may I ask for a favor?",
        "289": "What is it?",
        "290": "Would you be so kind as to send this missive to the wizarding post office for me? I have a pressing appointment with the healer and do not have the time to visit the post office myself.",
        "291": "Of course. And while you are at the healer, could you possibly retrieve some magical cold remedy for me?",
        "292": "Excuse me, can I be of assistance?",
        "293": "Would you kindly fill my broomstick with unleaded fuel?",
        "294": "Certainly, what type of fuel do you require?",
        "295": "Unleaded, if you please.",
        "296": "Very well, my friend.",
        "297": "I would be delighted to come and discuss the financing for our wizarding imports.",
        "298": "Good day, wizard. I've been asked to negotiate the terms of our trade deal.",
        "299": "Yes, of course. I am ready to discuss the details. What do you propose?",
        "300": "I suggest that we use a spell of telepathy to transfer the payment directly to your account.",
        "301": "Interesting proposal, but what if the spell fails or is intercepted?",
        "302": "In that case, we have a backup plan. We can use a spell of invisibility to transport gold coins to your location.",
        "303": "I like the sound of that. It's always good to have a backup plan. What about the delivery date?",
        "304": "We can use a spell of teleportation to deliver the goods within 24 hours of the payment being received.",
        "305": "Excellent. Those terms sound fair to me. Let us cast the necessary spells and finalize the deal.",
        "306": "I heard rumors of a new wizard in town. Have you seen him yet?",
        "307": "No, I have not. What have you heard about this new wizard?",
        "308": "I've heard that he is incredibly powerful and that he can perform magic that no one has ever seen before.",
        "309": "Really? That's quite intriguing. I would love to see this new wizard in action.",
        "310": "I heard that he is also quite mysterious and that no one knows where he came from.",
        "311": "Interesting. It seems that this new wizard has many secrets to uncover.",
        "312": "Yes, I agree. Perhaps we should seek him out and ask for a demonstration of his powers.",
        "313": "I think that would be a wise idea. Let us set out on this quest and discover the truth about this mysterious new wizard.",
        "314": "Do you need a broomstick or a flying carpet to travel, wizard?",
        "315": "I prefer to use a flying carpet. It is faster and more comfortable for long journeys.",
        "316": "Very well, I will have one ready for you. Let us set off on our journey to find the new wizard.",
        "317": "Great choices! I think I'll join you for the stir-fried squids. And while we're at it, we should try their special wizard brew cocktails too.",
        "318": "Wizard brew cocktails? That sounds intriguing. What kind of ingredients do they use?",
        "319": "Only the finest magical ingredients, my friend. They infuse it with enchanted herbs and spices to give it that extra kick.",
        "320": "Wow, this place just keeps getting better. I can't wait to try one of those wizard brew cocktails.",
        "321": "Me too! I've heard they even cast a spell of good luck on each one for the lucky drinker.",
        "322": "Let's make a toast to good food, good drinks, and good company then.",
        "323": "Agreed! To good food, good drinks, and good company!",
        "324": "So, while we're waiting for our food, do you want to cast some spells to pass the time?",
        "325": "Sure! What kind of spell do you want to cast?",
        "326": "I was thinking of a spell of good fortune. Maybe we can help bring some good luck to the other diners here.",
        "327": "That's a great idea! And who knows, maybe our good fortune spell will bring us some extra delicious dishes to try!",
        "328": "You're not too shabby either. I'm craving some steamed dragon claw, it's said to taste like a slice of heaven.",
        "329": "Let's head to the wizarding tavern and secure a table to order some grub.",
        "330": "Hold on a moment. I need to inform the wizard behind the seafood counter of our order.",
        "331": "Very well. I'll wait for you inside the tavern.",
        "332": "What do you say we try some deep-fried phoenix feathers?",
        "333": "Where are you headed off to?",
        "334": "I have an appointment at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magic Maladies and Injuries.",
        "335": "Hop in, I'll apparate us there.",
        "336": "How much will it cost for the trip?",
        "337": "It will cost ten Galleons.",
        "338": "By the way, what time is it?",
        "339": "You can check the time on your wizarding watch. I've got radio time.",
        "340": "It's a quarter to midnight. Could you please speed up the apparition?",
        "341": "Of course.",
        "342": "You've made a wise choice. This Chinese tea set from Jingdezhen is quite unique.",
        "343": "Where did it come from?",
        "344": "It was crafted in Jingdezhen, the Capital of Porcelain.",
        "345": "Jingdezhen? Isn't it known as the 'Capital of Porcelain'?",
        "346": "Indeed it is.",
        "347": "This is exactly what I've been envisioning.",
        "348": "This porcelain is of the finest quality, renowned for its delicate eggshell texture.",
        "349": "It must be highly prized indeed.",
        "350": "But it's worth every galleon, I assure you.",
        "351": "Greetings, Miao Li. Where might you be headed?",
        "352": "Hello, I'm off to the apothecary to purchase some fruits.",
        "353": "Ah, would you do me a favor, if you wouldn't mind?",
        "354": "Of course, what can I assist you with?",
        "355": "Would you mind posting this letter for me on your way to the apothecary?",
        "356": "Of course. Would you like it sent via owl post or with a wizarding postage stamp?",
        "357": "Yes, I believe a wizarding postage stamp would be best. There are some important photographs enclosed and I wouldn't want them to go astray.",
        "358": "No problem, I would be happy to send your letter for you.",
        "359": "Many thanks.",
        "360": "You're welcome.",
        "361": "I seem to have misplaced my wand-phone in my broomstick. It's likely on the floor on the passenger side. Would you mind retrieving it for me so I can contact the Ministry of Magic?",
        "362": "Of course, I will retrieve it for you.",
        "363": "It appears to be damaged beyond repair. I fear I must go to St. Mungo's. Can you take me there?",
        "364": "I think it might be best to make a report to the Ministry of Magic first. Then we can proceed to St. Mungo's.",
        "365": "Blast it! I'm injured here. The Ministry could take all day to arrive!",
        "366": "I'm afraid you'll just have to be patient. I won't move my broomstick until the Ministry arrives. I'll pop into one of these nearby wizarding homes and use their fireplace to contact them. Don't worry, you'll make it to St. Mungo's in time.",
        "367": "It hurts quite badly.",
        "368": "To be truthful, you've failed your driving test.",
        "369": "How come?",
        "370": "There were several reasons for that.",
        "371": "What were they?",
        "372": "Essentially, you simply can't drive.",
        "373": "Can I take it again?",
        "374": "You can retake it in a couple of weeks.",
        "375": "Good morning. What's wrong?",
        "376": "Good morning, doctor. I have a splitting headache.",
        "377": "Very well, young man. Tell me, how did it start?",
        "378": "Yesterday, I had a runny nose. Now my nose is congested, I have a sore throat and I fear I have a temperature. I feel awful.",
        "379": "Don't worry, young man. Let me give you an examination. First, let me take a look at your throat. Open your mouth and say 'ah'.",
        "380": "Ah.",
        "381": "Your throat is inflamed and your tongue is heavily coated. You have all the symptoms of the flu.",
        "382": "What should I do then?",
        "383": "All you need is rest and to drink more water. I'll write you a prescription.",
        "384": "Thank you very much.",
        "385": "My dear, what's on the menu for dinner?",
        "386": "Red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms.",
        "387": "What about soup?",
        "388": "Spicy-tangy soup brewed with fire.",
        "389": "What magic do you mix with it?",
        "390": "Ginger, garlic scallion, hot pepper, and vinegar will do the trick.",
        "391": "Excellent, shall I assist?",
        "392": "No need, I can cast spells on my own.",
        "393": "Thank you, now I can watch the magical moving picture box.",
        "394": "Next time, you must conjure the dinner, though.",
        "395": "Agreed, I will work my culinary magic next time.",
        "396": "Greetings, I am Mike, of the house of Kara.",
        "397": "Mike, it's a pleasure to hear from you. How fare thee?",
        "398": "All is well, and yourself?",
        "399": "I am thriving, thanks.",
        "400": "Kara, I enjoyed our outing to the magical moving picture box the other night and was wondering if you'd like to join me again this Friday.",
        "401": "Mike, I don't think it's wise to socialize at the moment. I am focused on packing for my return to my family home.",
        "402": "We could meet for a cup of tea, perhaps?",
        "403": "I cannot afford any distractions right now, but I am grateful for the lovely evening we shared.",
        "404": "Sunset Inn, may I be of assistance?",
        "405": "Indeed, I have reserved a room for the 24th. A double, if you please.",
        "406": "One moment, I shall check. Yes, that is correct. You will be staying for three days.",
        "407": "I have decided to change the reservation from the 24th to the 28th.",
        "408": "Very well, it shall be done.",
        "409": "Are you engaged tomorrow morn?",
        "410": "I am not, what is the matter?",
        "411": "Someone must collect the Headmaster from the wizarding airport.",
        "412": "Alas, I had forgotten I must draft a report.",
        "413": "I offer my sincerest apologies for my tardiness, it's been a difficult day.",
        "414": "It's ten past six, we're running behind. However, dinner is set for half-past six.",
        "415": "I am aware, I am sorry. I lost my satchel.",
        "416": "I shall send an owl to the lost and found office.",
        "417": "I failed to think of it, thank you. And once again, I apologize for my lateness.",
        "418": "Nani's Tome Emporium. May I assist you?",
        "419": "Do you happen to have a copy of 'The Man and the Sea' by Ernest Hemingway?",
        "420": "Indeed, we have one tome left.",
        "421": "Might I hold it for you?",
        "422": "Do you possess maps of the downtown wizarding district?",
        "423": "Yes, here you are.",
        "424": "What is the cost?",
        "425": "It is gratis, there is no charge.",
        "426": "My gratitude, thank you very much.",
        "427": "Greetings, I would like to reserve a wizarding inn room.",
        "428": "Pray tell, is it true that its moniker is linked to someone?",
        "429": "Indeed, the towel bears the name of its creator, Gustave Eiffel.",
        "430": "Greetings! Trans Pacific Airlines, how may I be of assistance?",
        "431": "I'm ringing to cancel my reservation for the Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19th from Taipei to Minneapolis. Might I change it to the same flight, but on August 2nd instead of the 19th?",
        "432": "May I have your name, if you please?",
        "433": "I am Judy Wang.",
        "434": "Might you spell your name for me, dear?",
        "435": "My given name is spelled J-U-D-Y, and my surname is W-A-N-G.",
        "436": "Please be advised that this ticket incurs a fee of 75 dollars for any alterations or cancellations.",
        "437": "Very well. Where should I go to pay this fee?",
        "438": "At the airport. All right, Miss Wang, your Flight 8 on July 19th from Taipei to Minneapolis has been cancelled. Your new reservation is for the Trans Pacific Flight 8 from Taipei to Minneapolis at 9:30 a.m. on August 2nd.",
        "439": "That would be 1POJ7403.",
        "440": "Correct, it is.",
        "441": "Many thanks!",
        "442": "Is there anything else I can assist you with?",
        "443": "No, thank you. I am all set. Farewell.",
        "444": "Is this the supplies department?",
        "445": "Indeed, it is. How may I be of service?",
        "446": "This is Rachel from Human Resources. I require two boxes of company letterhead, a box of ballpoint pens, and a box of envelopes.",
        "447": "Very well. Not a problem. May I have your extension number?",
        "448": "John, may I introduce you to Charles Brown, our new manager at the airport.",
        "449": "Of course, how will I know him?",
        "450": "He's short, sturdy, and has light blonde hair.",
        "451": "Anything else I should look for?",
        "452": "If my memory serves me well, he has a mustache and fair skin.",
        "453": "How old is he?",
        "454": "He's in his late thirties.",
        "455": "I should have no trouble spotting him then. What time is his flight due?",
        "456": "It arrives at 2:30pm.",
        "457": "What can I get for you today?",
        "458": "I'd like to have a hamburger, please.",
        "459": "Would you like cheese on that?",
        "460": "No, thank you.",
        "461": "Would you like a drink as well?",
        "462": "Yes, a soda would be great.",
        "463": "What kind of soda would you like?",
        "464": "A Sprite would be fine, thank you.",
        "465": "Of course, no trouble at all.",
        "466": "I would also like a bag of chips, please.",
        "467": "Will that be all for you today?",
        "468": "That concludes our business.",
        "469": "Do share with me your knowledge of insurance matters.",
        "470": "At wizarding college, I studied the arts of international banking, including various insurance courses. And I honed my skills during my internship at an insurance firm.",
        "471": "Why have you taken an interest in becoming an insurance wizard?",
        "472": "I am passionate about helping others and I understand the significance of securing one's possessions through insurance.",
        "473": "Have you any prior experience in sales?",
        "474": "Indeed, I have. I have served as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd.",
        "475": "Are you well-liked by those you come into contact with?",
        "476": "Indeed, I possess a way with people that often leads to favorable outcomes.",
        "477": "Ah, here we are.",
        "478": "This is the establishment I mentioned to you earlier.",
        "479": "Would you prefer a seat near the window, friend?",
        "480": "Very well.",
        "481": "Let us peruse the menu. Oh dear, it seems there is no menu. Could you kindly ask the patrons at the next table if they would be so kind as to allow us to see theirs?",
        "482": "Of course. Excuse me. Pardon the intrusion, but could we have a look at your menu? I see, they do not have one either.",
        "483": "Do you have intentions of purchasing a broomstick?",
        "484": "I am still considering it. May I inquire as to its cost?",
        "485": "350 Knuts.",
        "486": "Oh dear, it seems a bit steep. Could you extend a more reasonable offer?",
        "487": "Your discount has already been taken into account. Normally, we ask 400 Knuts, but during this sale period, we are able to offer a special price.",
        "488": "Can it not be procured at a lesser price, my dear wizard?",
        "489": "Alas, this is the fairest of prices. No further reduction shall be made.",
        "490": "Very well then, might I be able to pay with wizarding traveler's drafts?",
        "491": "I'm afraid not, the payment in gold galleons is most preferred.",
        "492": "Do you have a moment to spare?",
        "493": "Of course, what can I assist you with?",
        "494": "I am having some trouble operating this dragon scale press.",
        "495": "Let me see, have you tried turning the fire-breathing knob?",
        "496": "Ah, yes, my apologies.",
        "497": "Now try pressing the dragon's tail button.",
        "498": "Oh dear, it seems to be out of dragon scales. Do you have any extra?",
        "499": "Just a moment, I'll go retrieve some for you.",
        "500": "I am in need of help with the broomstick dryer and washer.",
        "501": "What seems to be the issue?",
        "502": "I cannot seem to figure out how to turn them on.",
        "503": "Do you have any flimsy flying feathers?",
        "504": "I did not know I needed feathers.",
        "505": "The washer requires three feathers and the dryer requires five.",
        "506": "Where do I place the feathers?",
        "507": "Simply place the feathers in the slot, and the machines should activate.",
        "508": "Is that all that must be done, my friend?",
        "509": "That is all there is, indeed.",
        "510": "I am grateful for your assistance in this matter.",
        "511": "If there is anything else you require, simply let me know.",
        "512": "Do you have any further inquiries?",
        "513": "Yes, must I work an entire year before I am able to take a holiday?",
        "514": "Indeed, once you have been here a year, you shall be eligible for a three-day leave.",
        "515": "Only three days, you say?",
        "516": "That is the company policy, I'm afraid.",
        "517": "And what happens if I have exhausted my sick days before the end of the year? Will I lose pay if I am unwell for an extra day or two?",
        "518": "Unfortunately, that is indeed the company policy.",
        "519": "It is the same as the last place where I was employed. I had hoped that things would be different here.",
        "520": "I am famished beyond measure.",
        "521": "Indeed, I too am quite hungry.",
        "522": "Where did you have in mind for us to go for our meal?",
        "523": "I was considering that we should go to the great hall for our repast.",
        "524": "I don't recall ever having dined in the great hall before.",
        "525": "I actually quite enjoy the fare served there.",
        "526": "Does the great hall offer a diverse array of edibles?",
        "527": "They have anything your heart desires, my friend.",
        "528": "I've been considering purchasing some delicious Chinese cuisine.",
        "529": "I savored some delicious chow mein at the Great Hall. It was truly scrumptious.",
        "530": "We can dine at the Great Hall.",
        "531": "I believe the fare at the Great Hall will be most enjoyable.",
        "532": "Mr. Brown, allow me to present you with this draft of the contract. Let us peruse the provisions and determine if we are in agreement on all of them. Afterwards, I shall create an original copy. Then, all that will be left to do is to complete the contract and affix our signatures.",
        "533": "That shall be acceptable.",
        "534": "The contract must be written in both Chinese and English, both of which shall hold equal weight.",
        "535": "Very well. If you'll excuse me, I would like to give it a thorough review. Hmm, you've done a splendid job. It is well-prepared.",
        "536": "My gratitude to you.",
        "537": "I suggest we only discuss the provisions and points where our opinions differ in order to conserve time.",
        "538": "A wise proposal.",
        "539": "Let us begin with Clause Two regarding the packing. Our standard practice is to ship our equipment in containers, which is both time-saving and cost-effective. However, your contract specifies the use of wooden cases. Hence, we request that the contract include the words 'containers are acceptable.'",
        "540": "Agreed.",
        "541": "Regarding the shipment, we are producing a full set of equipment for you, and it will not all be ready at once. Thus, would you permit us to make partial shipments?",
        "542": "I comprehend your stance.",
        "543": "I desire to purchase a black suit.",
        "544": "Of course. Would you prefer a double-breasted or single-breasted suit?",
        "545": "I would prefer a single-breasted suit.",
        "546": "What about this one? It's an elegant three-piece suit.",
        "547": "That appears quite striking. Do you have any neckties available?",
        "548": "Greetings! It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Diane.",
        "549": "Greetings, Jack. It's lovely to meet you as well.",
        "550": "I presume you've had a change of heart regarding our proposal, Diane.",
        "551": "Indeed. After much consideration, I must admit the quality of your air conditioners is most impressive. The only issue at hand is the cost.",
        "552": "It doesn't surprise me, many customers share your sentiment. Might you have any suggestions? Our sales associate informed your secretary that the price may be negotiable.",
        "553": "That's why I made the journey to your office today. Our suggestion is for the model WE-506 to be priced at $590, as similar air conditioners from other companies are typically priced between $579 and $649.",
        "554": "That is true, but if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product, you'll agree that $679 is not excessive, especially with a 10% discount we're offering.",
        "555": "I can see your point. So that would be $611 per set. However, that is still higher than the market price. Is there any way to lower the cost, Jack?",
        "556": "Well, given the quantity of your order, we could reduce the price further to $600. That's the lowest we can go. What do you think of that?",
        "557": "Agreed. $600 per set it is then.",
        "558": "Very good. Many thanks.",
        "559": "Have we met before?",
        "560": "I'm not certain. You look familiar, though.",
        "561": "Are you Mr. Stevenson, by any chance?",
        "562": "Yes, that's correct. And you are Mr. Jones, if I'm not mistaken.",
        "563": "And with that, we've covered all the basic information about our company. I trust you have a good understanding of who we are.",
        "564": "Indeed, I have a general knowledge of your company.",
        "565": "Once we have the final results, we shall send word to you.",
        "566": "And when can I expect a response at the latest?",
        "567": "Should you pass the interview, the personnel department will inform you within two fortnights.",
        "568": "But if I don't pass, shall I expect to hear from you?",
        "569": "I'm afraid not. Give it a fortnight, if you don't receive a Howler, then I'm afraid it means your application was unsuccessful.",
        "570": "Then is there any hope for me getting this position?",
        "571": "I'm sorry, but the final decision is not in my hands, and I must confer with the other interviewing panel members.",
        "572": "Understood. Regardless of the outcome, I've gained much insight from our discussion.",
        "573": "A commendable outlook, well done.",
        "574": "Many thanks for offering me the chance to interview.",
        "575": "You're welcome, it was my pleasure.",
        "576": "I've a bit of a tummy ache.",
        "577": "Best you lie down then, a bit of rest is just what you need.",
        "578": "Very well, I shall.",
        "579": "What sort of personality would you say you have?",
        "580": "I'd say I'm quite active and full of energy. I tackle things with enthusiasm and don't like to leave a job half-done.",
        "581": "Would you consider yourself introverted or extroverted?",
        "582": "I'd say I'm quite outgoing, I enjoy socializing and doing things with others.",
        "583": "What do you believe is the most important factor in your happiness?",
        "584": "I firmly believe that having close friends is the key. One cannot live in solitude, after all. A true friend is a treasure indeed, and the more I have, the merrier I am.",
        "585": "What sort of people do you prefer to work alongside?",
        "586": "I value honesty, commitment, and integrity in my colleagues.",
        "587": "I'd like to take a moment to extend a warm welcome to Monica, our newest addition to the finance department. We've hired Monica for her expertise as a professional accountant, and I'm sure you'll all find her an asset to the team. With her extensive accounting experience, I'm positive you'll all learn from her.",
        "588": "Hail and well met! I am Monica, newly arrived to the finance department. 'Tis an honor to make your acquaintance and I eagerly look forward to working alongside all of thee. I shall do my utmost to get up to speed with our tasks as swiftly as possible. Pray, call me Monica; that is what all others do.",
        "589": "Were ye in a position of leadership while at Hogwarts?",
        "590": "Indeed I was. I served as the Head of the Student Council during my time at Hogwarts.",
        "591": "Didst thou receive any accolades or awards while at Hogwarts?",
        "592": "Yes, I was awarded the title of 'Excellent Party Member' for four consecutive academic years.",
        "593": "Didst thou participate in any club activities during your days at Hogwarts?",
        "594": "Yes, I was a proud member of the Student Poetry Society. 'Tis a favourite pastime of mine, writing verse.",
        "595": "What other extracurricular activities didst thou typically engage in at Hogwarts?",
        "596": "On occasion, I would play a friendly game of wizard's chess or fly on my broomstick.",
        "597": "Margaret, let us discuss the preparations for our company retreat which is to take place next month. We must secure a suitable location, make arrangements for guest speakers, door prizes, activities, and lodgings. 'Tis also of utmost importance that we determine which of our staff will be eligible and available to attend. We need an accurate headcount so that we may make the necessary reservations.",
        "598": "What are the criteria for staff to attend the retreat? Shall it be limited to our management team or shall lower level employees also be invited to attend?",
        "599": "Lower level employees shall not be in attendance. The retreat is for training purposes, specifically for our management team. Our aim is to create a well-oiled machine at the executive level, and to foster a sense of camaraderie among the team, we've included some leisure activities as well. That's the purpose of the retreat.",
        "600": "I believe yoga may be suitable for me.",
        "601": "And why might that be?",
        "602": "Because 'tis not demanding of great deal of energy and is thus more manageable for me.",
        "603": "But I've seen witches and wizards perspiring heavily during yoga as well.",
        "604": "I cannot say for certain, but I'd like to give it a try. I am in dire need of some form of exercise to shed some weight.",
        "605": "Thou may want to try taking a dip in the lake. 'Tis a great way to stay fit.",
        "606": "We are in search of a secretary who is bilingual. Wouldst thou say that thou art proficient in both written and spoken English?",
        "607": "I daresay my command of the English language is quite impressive. My academic record showcases my mastery, having earned a Bachelor of Arts in the subject, where I honed my linguistic and literary skills through extensive study.",
        "608": "It's not a problem. Might I have the pleasure of knowing your full name?",
        "609": "Of course, I am John Sandals.",
        "610": "Greetings Mr. Sandals, I am Michelle, at your service. What dates will you require the room?",
        "611": "I plan to be there from the 14th to the 17th of April.",
        "612": "Our rooms have a new rate, sir. Are you comfortable with this arrangement?",
        "613": "Well, it depends on the price, naturally. What is the rate?",
        "614": "The nightly rate is $308.",
        "615": "That shall not be a problem for me.",
        "616": "Fantastic! Would you prefer a smoking or non-smoking room?",
        "617": "Non-smoking, I cannot abide the smell.",
        "618": "Non-smoking it is. And, will a queen-sized bed be acceptable?",
        "619": "No problem.",
        "620": "Excellent, Mr. Sandals. Your reservation is confirmed. May I have your phone number, so I may reach you if necessary?",
        "621": "Certainly! My phone number is 626-555-1739.",
        "622": "Thank you very much, Mr. Sandals. We look forward to your arrival!",
        "623": "Might I have my bill, if you please?",
        "624": "Of course, sir.",
        "625": "I'm afraid there has been a mistake.",
        "626": "I apologize, sir. What seems to be the trouble?",
        "627": "I believe I have been charged twice for the same item. You see, the figure of 6.5 galleons appears here and then again here.",
        "628": "What are your quill skills like, my dear?",
        "629": "I can transcribe at a pace of 80 words per minute without error, and my hand is quick enough to take dictation in the English language at a speed of 120 words per minute.",
        "630": "Are these the robes you desire to have cleaned, madam?",
        "631": "Aye, when might I retrieve them?",
        "632": "If they are collected posthaste, you may have them returned to you this very evening.",
        "633": "That is acceptable. Please ensure my suit is treated with a scouring charm, if you would be so kind.",
        "634": "Very well, kindly fill out the registry first.",
        "635": "What ails me, good Healer? I find myself feeling quite fatigued of late.",
        "636": "Your blood pressure is the cause, I'm afraid. 'Tis far too elevated.",
        "637": "What could be the root of this issue?",
        "638": "O'erwork, amongst other causes. One cannot toil for 24 hours a day. You must take it easier, lest you drive yourself to exhaustion.",
        "639": "But I cannot simply cease my labors.",
        "640": "You must, I fear. And have you not noticed? You weigh 200 stone. 'Tis far too much for one of your stature.",
        "641": "Are you suggesting I must shed some weight?",
        "642": "Aye. You must reduce your intake of bread and potatoes, and take more exercise.",
        "643": "You rise early, Tom. What do you do with your mornings?",
        "644": "I engage in physical activity. The morning hours are the most precious of the day and should not be wasted. I seize the time and put it to good use.",
        "645": "So, you spend your mornings building your strength. Where do you typically train?",
        "646": "Typically, I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up. The admission is free of charge. Then, I commence my regimen.",
        "647": "Do you follow the same regimen every day?",
        "648": "Nay, I have made sure to maintain a delicate balance between various exercises - bars in parallel, press-ups, crunches, bunny hops, and a five-kilometer gallop, and so forth. I alternate them through the weekdays. At times, when I find myself feeling under the weather, I might simply meander through the gardens to clear my thoughts.",
        "649": "Why not simply remain in bed on such days, when your body is not up for any form of exertion?",
        "650": "Keeping up with good habits can be challenging, as you are aware. I fear that if I were to remain in bed for a day, it might only become harder to rise early the following day. Furthermore, a leisurely walk in the cool morning air is a delight. In the gardens, one encounters groups of elders who might be singing grand operas, playing musical instruments, or simply socializing and exchanging gossip. It is always intriguing to observe them.",
        "651": "Indeed, singing can be a means of keeping fit, not only of the body but also the mind.",
        "652": "I am seeking recommendations for some beauty products. Might you be able to suggest any?",
        "653": "Pond's is widely regarded as the finest choice.",
        "654": "Unfortunately, they are quite costly.",
        "655": "Ah, but today they are available at a special price.",
        "656": "Perfect, that is just what I was hoping for.",
        "657": "Steven, I am to embark upon my first journey by air tomorrow. Might you be able to offer any advice and caution me on what I should keep an eye out for?",
        "658": "Firstly, it is imperative that you get a good night's rest to ensure that you are well-rested and ready to conquer the effects of jet lag. Such journeys can often leave one feeling fatigued for several days after.",
        "659": "I shall retire to bed early this evening, then.",
        "660": "Are you prone to airsickness, perchance?",
        "661": "I cannot say for certain, but I am prone to motion sickness when traveling by carriage.",
        "662": "It might be wise to bring along some remedies for airsickness, just in case.",
        "663": "Thank you, I shall do so.",
        "664": "Might we schedule a time to view houses together?",
        "665": "Would the mornings or the afternoons be more convenient for you?",
        "666": "Either would suit me just fine.",
        "667": "There are several houses available for viewing this coming weekend in your area. Does that work for you?",
        "668": "I could take a sabbatical from Hogwarts, or we could journey to Hogsmeade for the weekend, either way.",
        "669": "We could convene at the wizarding real estate agency, or I could collect you from your wizarding abode.",
        "670": "I am departing from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, so perhaps I could merely meet you at the first domicile we shall inspect.",
        "671": "I can think of five wizarding homes that we ought to survey. It will occupy most of the day.",
        "672": "I would like to see as many as possible, if it please you.",
        "673": "When I have received confirmation from the owners, I shall send an owl with our itinerary for the day.",
        "674": "Do you offer a wizarding tour to Hollywood?",
        "675": "Indeed, here is the schedule. Which plan suits your fancy best?",
        "676": "The seven-day sojourn shall suffice. Pray, how much does this tour cost?",
        "677": "Three hundred galleons.",
        "678": "We shall take the journey. Could you provide us with a brochure?",
        "679": "Of course, here you are.",
        "680": "What is the matter? Matters are becoming disordered. You persist in intermeddling where you are not wanted.",
        "681": "What do you imply?",
        "682": "Presently, I am tasked with instructing new students, but you persist in interfering with my authority by advocating your methods. I am aware that you are a talented wizard with much to prove, but I do not approve of your manner.",
        "683": "Mother, upon your return to our wizarding abode, kindly purchase a cloak, a robe, and a sweater...",
        "684": "Enough is enough, I comprehend.",
        "685": "Mr. Chen, would you object if I were to smoke a wizarding cigarette?",
        "686": "I apologize, Mrs. Lin. We do not allow smoking within the wizarding office.",
        "687": "Good morning, may I assist you?",
        "688": "I would like to partake in an American-style breakfast, including fried eggs with the yolks facing upwards.",
        "689": "And what type of juice would you prefer, good sir?",
        "690": "A juice to accompany breakfast and a black coffee, brewed extra strong, if you please.",
        "691": "Very good, sir. An American breakfast with sunny-side-up fried eggs, breakfast juice, and a strong black coffee. Is that correct, sir?",
        "692": "Indeed, that is correct.",
        "693": "Would there be anything else, sir?",
        "694": "No, that shall be all. Thank you.",
        "695": "Good morning, sir. Your requested breakfast has arrived.",
        "696": "Just place it on the table, if you would be so kind.",
        "697": "Is there anything else I can bring you, sir?",
        "698": "No, thank you. Ah, wait, could I trouble you for some juice to stock the minibar?",
        "699": "Certainly, sir. Which type of juice would you prefer: tomato or orange?",
        "700": "Tomato or orange juice, if you please.",
        "701": "At once, sir. Could you sign this bill first, please? Thank you, sir.",
        "702": "Shall we leave a gratuity? This service has been quite excellent.",
        "703": "I believe so. How much is considered standard?",
        "704": "How about a ten percent tip? That would come to around six galleons.",
        "705": "That seems fair and reasonable.",
        "706": "When does the train for Tibet depart, may I ask?",
        "707": "It shall depart at three in the afternoon, good sir or madam.",
        "708": "When shall it arrive, good sir?",
        "709": "It is due to arrive at the hour of 7 and thirty minutes on the morrow.",
        "710": "Pray tell, how much is the cost of a ticket?",
        "711": "The cost of a coach ticket is 86 galleons and a berth shall cost thee 175 galleons.",
        "712": "One berth, if you please.",
        "713": "Taxi, ho!",
        "714": "Where might you be headed, kind sir?",
        "715": "To the Beijing Library, if you would be so kind.",
        "716": "Step inside, if you please.",
        "717": "Is the journey to the Beijing Library a long one?",
        "718": "It shall take us approximately thirty minutes, for it is the hour of rush.",
        "719": "Thirty minutes shall suffice. Fifty minutes remain before the library shall open its doors. Observe, what are they doing in the square?",
        "720": "It is an exhibition of Chinese jades, held annually. A magnificent collection of jades is on display and for sale.",
        "721": "Sounds delightful! Could we stop for a moment? I must purchase a few trinkets for my friends.",
        "722": "It shall be my pleasure.",
        "723": "How many pieces of luggage shall you be checking in, good sir?",
        "724": "I shall be checking in three bags and a suitcase. This is my luggage to be checked.",
        "725": "Do you have any luggage to carry on?",
        "726": "Nay.",
        "727": "Place your luggage upon the scale, if you please. Ah, it seems your luggage is over the weight limit.",
        "728": "Pray tell, how much would the charge for an excess of baggage be?",
        "729": "Twenty-two galleons.",
        "730": "Here you are, sir.",
        "731": "This is your voucher, sir. You may collect your belongings with it upon your return. Safe travels!",
        "732": "Thank you kindly!",
        "733": "On what date do you desire to depart, sir?",
        "734": "Might you have any available seats on the 16th of September?",
        "735": "Let us see... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked. However, I have seats available on the 17th.",
        "736": "The 17th shall be acceptable.",
        "737": "And when might you be returning, sir?",
        "738": "Hmmm... I believe it shall be the 28th.",
        "739": "Very well, you are booked on American Airlines flight 710, departing from JFK at 6.",
        "740": "Excellent, thank you very much.",
        "741": "I seek to purchase a black suit.",
        "742": "Might you have any specific brands in mind, miss?",
        "743": "No, I rarely wear suits in my daily life. I require one for my sister's wedding ceremony.",
        "744": "I see. Might I suggest this one? It is quite inexpensive, however, it may not endure long.",
        "745": "Though it appears quite handsome. May I try it on?",
        "746": "Very well, the mirror is over there.",
        "747": "How may I be of assistance, miss?",
        "748": "I seek a pair of enchanted footwear.",
        "749": "Would thee prefer stilettos or flat-soled shoes?",
        "750": "High heels, if you please. I aim to don them for formal gatherings.",
        "751": "Greetings, Jim. Dost thou have a moment to spare?",
        "752": "Certainly, what brings you to me?",
        "753": "A number of us are forming a quidditch team. Would thou like to join us?",
        "754": "I'm afraid I have little knowledge of the sport, as quidditch is not as popular in my homeland.",
        "755": "Fear not, we shall guide thee.",
        "756": "Is it similar to the game of Muggle football?",
        "757": "Nay, it is more akin to hockey, except the ball is larger and nary a stick is employed.",
        "758": "I shall visit and observe a match one day, to better understand the sport.",
        "759": "A wise choice. I'm sure you'll find it to your liking, given a chance.",
        "760": "Do you recall what the movie rating system signifies?",
        "761": "Indeed, G is for General Audiences, PG signifies Parental Guidance is recommended, R is restricted to those under 18 years of age, and X indicates explicit content.",
        "762": "Do people still take heed of those classifications?",
        "763": "Do you remember the days when children were not permitted to attend PG-rated movies without a guardian?",
        "764": "I recall that X-rated films were scarce to come by.",
        "765": "Nowadays, with video rentals, it is a matter of personal discretion.",
        "766": "Aye, I've not seen theaters turn away patrons due to age restrictions in quite some time.",
        "767": "We are now left to make our own decisions about what we do and do not wish to view.",
        "768": "Pray, why are thou struggling in thy class?",
        "769": "The teachings are quite abstract, making it difficult to comprehend.",
        "770": "Reservation, may I be of assistance?",
        "771": "Indeed, I seek to reserve a chamber for next Monday.",
        "772": "One moment, if thou wouldst. Allow me to verify it.",
        "773": "By the by, I desire a spacious chamber.",
        "774": "At present, we have a suite for four, would thou like to book it?",
        "775": "Aye, that is what I seek. I shall take the chamber for two days.",
        "776": "Hail Mel! Art thou game for a match of tennis today?",
        "777": "Alas, I cannot! I must attend to work, retrieve Jake and Maddie from Hogwarts, provide them with an afternoon refreshment, then accompany Jake to Quidditch practice and Maddie to dance lessons.",
        "778": "Thou dost sound fatigued. Perhaps thou shouldst seek the aid of a house-elf to assist thee. She could fetch the young ones from Hogwarts and accompany them to their after-school activities. She could also assist thee with household chores, and run errands.",
        "779": "Oh, I know not... it is a difficult task to find the right house-elf. Thou must consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities thou wouldst give her, and how she interacts with the young ones. I would love to have such assistance, but it is a daunting task to find the right match.",
        "780": "I believe thou shouldst give it due consideration! This way thou wouldst not have to manage such a busy schedule, and thou wouldst still be able to spend time with the young ones in the evenings. I could refer thee to a most excellent house-elf.",
        "781": "Oh, that is grand. Many thanks Grace. Could thou give me her number? I shall discuss it with Dan and give her a call tomorrow. Perchance, this way I shall not be so weary each day, and Dan and I might even have the chance to go...",
        "782": "Canst thou tell that I am filled with excitement?",
        "783": "Pray, what has thou become so excited about?",
        "784": "I cast my vote today.",
        "785": "Was this thy first time?",
        "786": "I turned 18 just last month.",
        "787": "Thou art most fortunate.",
        "788": "What art thou implying?",
        "789": "For thou hast come of age in a year of great political upheaval.",
        "790": "I had not considered such a thing.",
        "791": "Had thou not?",
        "792": "Indeed not, but I remain exhilarated nonetheless.",
        "793": "Thou should be, for thou art now a part of history.",
        "794": "May I be of assistance?",
        "795": "Aye. I seek a pair of shoes to purchase.",
        "796": "Hast thou a specific design in mind?",
        "797": "Perchance sneakers or sturdy footwear.",
        "798": "Is there a particular brand thou wouldst prefer?",
        "799": "Might I inspect that pair of canvas shoes? They appear quite lovely.",
        "800": "Observe, how grand and magnificent the tour of the Tiananmen Gate is!",
        "801": "What is the significance of the Tiananmen?",
        "802": "It is the largest public square in the world, home to a monument to the people's hero and the Chairman Mao memorial hall to the south. To the west stands the Great Hall of the People, and to the east, two museums. ",
        "803": "And what is that yonder?",
        "804": "Why, that be the Forbidden City, to the north of the Gate building.",
        "805": "All sights in China are most beguiling. A journey to this land is most certainly worth one's time. My thanks for thy guidance, and I shall miss thee.",
        "806": "I have collided with a fence post, resulting in injury. What say thou to this matter? Blast and damnation, it hurts considerably!",
        "807": "We must hasten thee to a wizarding hospital. I shall take thee upon the back of my broomstick.",
        "808": "I narrowly escaped death's grasp, careening down the road at a breakneck speed of forty-five miles per hour. The corner was slick with gravel, and I lost control, skidding towards oblivion.",
        "809": "Indeed, I too was nearly thrown off course. Now then, let's tighten this tourniquet and stem the flow of blood. Wrap the wound with bandages, and then we shall be off. By Merlin's beard, this hurts.",
        "810": "Very well, I am tightening it as we speak. Tell me when to stop.",
        "811": "There, it's done.",
        "812": "Mr. James, I know that office hours have come to a close, but might I trouble you to work this weekend and complete the translations?",
        "813": "Alas, I have a prior engagement this weekend. Let me see...",
        "814": "My apologies, but I am willing to offer double pay for your time and effort. Will this do?",
        "815": "That is most generous. When do you require these translations?",
        "816": "I require them by Monday afternoon for a conference. Do you think it can be done?",
        "817": "I shall do my utmost to make it so.",
        "818": "Thank you so much, Mr. James.",
        "819": "Fear not, for your little one is safe and sound in my care.",
        "820": "How may I ever repay your kindness? I am in your debt.",
        "821": "My sincerest apologies, sir. My mode of transportation has failed me.",
        "822": "A shame. Is there anything we can do to assist?",
        "823": "I fear not.",
        "824": "Then I must call for alternative transportation, lest I be tardy.",
        "825": "Greetings. I seek to have my footwear repaired.",
        "826": "Pray, what seems to be the issue?",
        "827": "I'll just go and check it for you , sir .",
        "828": "Good evening , madam . Can I help you ?",
        "829": "Yes . I bought this sheet here yesterday .",
        "830": "Anything wrong with it ?",
        "831": "Yes . When I spread it out back home , I found this hole .",
        "832": "Oh , how awful ! May I have a look at the invoice ?",
        "833": "Here it is .",
        "834": "Well . please accept our sincere apologies , I'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .",
        "835": "That's very kind of you . Thank you .",
        "836": "We're sorry that this has happened , and I guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again .",
        "837": "I need to buy some flowers for my wife .",
        "838": "Perhaps you'd be interested in red roses .",
        "839": "What would the roses cost me ?",
        "840": "They're only $ 20 a dozen .",
        "841": "I like the sound of that .",
        "842": "Yes , that is today's sale price .",
        "843": "A dozen will be fine .",
        "844": "Is there anything else you'd like to get ?",
        "845": "No , thank you .",
        "846": "These roses should make your wife very happy .",
        "847": "Gaze upon the heels of thy footwear, for they appear to be slanting.",
        "848": "Fear not, for I possess the skill to repair them with precision.",
        "849": "Pray tell, what shall be the cost of the mending?",
        "850": "Six coins of yuan shall be the price, and I shall restore thy heels to their former glory.",
        "851": "I must say, the price seems quite steep. I would offer four yuan instead, or I may seek assistance elsewhere.",
        "852": "Very well, I shall attend to the mending of thy heels.",
        "853": "May I inquire, how long shall the task take? Might I sit and wait as thou repairst them?",
        "854": "Indeed, the task shall be completed in but a few moments.",
        "855": "Fantastic! I shall take my seat here and wait with anticipation.",
        "856": "Greetings!",
        "857": "Greetings, is this Stefan whom I address?",
        "858": "Alas, thou hast dialed the incorrect number. There is no one by the name of Stefan here.",
        "859": "Surely, thou jest. I called previously and spoke with Stefan himself.",
        "860": "I assure thee, thou hast the wrong number. This number hath been mine for over two decades.",
        "861": "This cannot be so. I recall the number distinctly. Is it not 1199886?",
        "862": "Nay, the number is incorrect. It is 1199866. Thou hast dialed an incorrect number.",
        "863": "My apologies for the inconvenience. I am truly sorry for bothering thee.",
        "864": "Fear not, such mistakes are common amongst us all.",
        "865": "My sincerest apologies once again.",
        "866": "Think nothing of it.",
        "867": "Good day, kind sir. How may I be of assistance?",
        "868": "Good day to you as well. I am here to visit with Rochelle Davis, the Head of the Department of Human Resources.",
        "869": "Do you have a prior appointment with her?",
        "870": "Indeed I do. I am scheduled to meet with her at half past ten this morn.",
        "871": "Very well. May I have your name, please?",
        "872": "Bruce Green, at your service.",
        "873": "Thank you. Please be seated, she will attend to you promptly.",
        "874": "My gratitude, kind sir.",
        "875": "Excuse me, good sir. Might I inquire as to the time?",
        "876": "Ah, it is near the hour of eleven and twenty.",
        "877": "Thank you for your kindness.",
        "878": "You are most welcome. May I observe that the rain is coming down quite heavily today?",
        "879": "Yes, I was in a hurry and alas, I forgot my umbrella.",
        "880": "Fear not, I have one. Would you care to share it as we walk? Which way are you headed?",
        "881": "That is most generous of you. I am bound for the Garden Hotel.",
        "882": "As it happens, I too am headed that way. Shall we make the journey together?",
        "883": "Indeed, I would be delighted to join you.",
        "884": "I am most intrigued by the art of Chinese antiques.",
        "885": "We have a magnificent collection of Chinese antiques, including an array of landscape paintings, portraits, and the most magnificent flower and bird paintings you have ever seen.",
        "886": "I would like to purchase a flower and bird painting, if I may.",
        "887": "What do you think of this painting of cranes amongst pine trees, crafted by a renowned painter during the King Dynasty?",
        "888": "By Merlin, they look almost lifelike.",
        "889": "And, in traditional wizarding belief, cranes and pine trees symbolize a long and fruitful life.",
        "890": "It's time for me to depart. My name is Ruth Carson. Might I have my bill, please?",
        "891": "Yes, it comes to 167 Galleons.",
        "892": "Much obliged.",
        "893": "Well, Mitzuko-san, I do hope you enjoy your stay. This restaurant is my personal favorite in Taipei. It brings back memories of my travels throughout Europe during my younger years.",
        "894": "It looks truly magical. Very authentic.",
        "895": "The chef was trained in Florence. Their pasta dishes are simply magnificent.",
        "896": "Understood. What do you recommend?",
        "897": "Hmm... You must try the mushroom fettucine. It's a spellbinding dish.",
        "898": "Is it particularly salty?",
        "899": "Not in the slightest. It has a very delicate flavor.",
        "900": "What does 'Duppa del Giono' mean? I apologize, I'm not sure how to pronounce it.",
        "901": "Oh, it means 'soup of the day'. I'll ask the waiter what they have available today. Have you considered trying the mussels cooked in the Italian way? They're delectable.",
        "902": "No, I haven't. That sounds like an excellent idea.",
        "903": "I am calling to inquire about the available position for an usher.",
        "904": "Is there anything in particular you would like to know?",
        "905": "What qualities are you seeking in an applicant for the position of an usher?",
        "906": "We require the candidate for the role of usher to be comely, stand no less than 5 feet 5 inches tall, and have an affinity for smiling.",
        "907": "Greetings, good Madam, may I assist you in finding something?",
        "908": "Indeed, I am searching for a camera to purchase.",
        "909": "We have a vast array of choices. Do you have a preference between a point-and-shoot or a more sophisticated one? Might I inquire if you're purchasing this for yourself or someone else?",
        "910": "In truth, I am seeking a camera for my husband.",
        "911": "Ah, in that case, I would recommend a fine entry-level digital SLR.",
        "912": "Might I have a glance at the options available, good Sir?",
        "913": "Of course, follow me. This here is the...",
        "914": "The Canon Eos. It is adequate, however, I am in search of something with improved performance in low light, a finer display panel, and a longer battery life.",
        "915": "Oh, hm, the Nikon D60 is a sound choice.",
        "916": "Yes, but what lens is included in this kit? I do not desire a cumbersome telephoto lens.",
        "917": "Oh, let's see, it appears to come with an 18-55 mm lens. A standard option that should suffice. After all, my husband will not be stalking celebrities or anything of the sort!",
        "918": "So, um, might I tempt you with any accessories...?",
        "919": "Accessories? Do you have polarizing filters available?",
        "920": "Polarizing filters? Let me see... I am afraid we are currently out of stock, good Madam.",
        "921": "Nonsense! There are some right here!",
        "922": "Oh my! It seems we have polarizing filters available after all!",
        "923": "Many thanks for your assistance, Ralph!",
        "924": "It was my pleasure, good Madam.",
        "925": "May I be of service to you, good Madam?",
        "926": "Pray tell, where might I find the Apparition point for New York?",
        "927": "You must first check in at Counter No. 4.",
        "928": "Is that the one yonder?",
        "929": "Indeed, then follow the signage to Platform 85.",
        "930": "My thanks. You have been most helpful.",
        "931": "Mr. Crandall, I regret to say that I cannot fathom the reasoning behind starting this project anew. 'Twill require a great deal of effort.",
        "932": "That is quite true. But such is the nature of our profession, Maria. There can be no question that the current project is unacceptable.",
        "933": "I concur. Yet, I believe that a few modifications could remedy the situation. Might I have the chance to prove myself?",
        "934": "Very well, Maria. I shall grant you until the hour of four tomorrow to produce satisfactory results, else you shall have to repeat the endeavor.",
        "935": "I believe 'tis time to confront my admirer and set him to rights.",
        "936": "Is that so? How do you plan to make contact?",
        "937": "I shall leave him a message, affixed to my workstation.",
        "938": "What does it say? Do you anticipate that he shall read it?",
        "939": "He shall. It states, 'I have a sweet tooth. Meet me at half past two in the carriage park.' ",
        "940": "Might I observe from the window?",
        "941": "Nay, I shall keep you abreast of the situation later. At present, I must locate Vince.",
        "942": "There is still much left. Would you care for another serving?",
        "943": "Aye, I should like that. 'Tis quite delicious.",
        "944": "Pardon me, does this Knight Bus travel to the new shop of books?",
        "945": "Nay, you must disembark at the bank and take the No. 50.",
        "946": "Many thanks. Pray tell, what is the cost of passage to yonder stop?",
        "947": "One Galleon, milady.",
        "948": "How many stops must we endure before arrival?",
        "949": "Two more stops after this one, my friend.",
        "950": "Might I impose upon you to inform me when we shall reach our destination?",
        "951": "Of course, I shall be happy to oblige.",
        "952": "By the way, do I require another transfer after Stop No. 50?",
        "953": "Nay, a No. 50 shall take thee directly to thy desired location.",
        "954": "Thou hast my gratitude.",
        "955": "And how go the preparations for thy nuptials?",
        "956": "Very well, I thank thee. We began organizing everything early to avoid any last-minute rush. The only thing that is yet to be ready is my wedding gown.",
        "957": "When will it be ready, pray?",
        "958": "The dressmakers say that it shall be ready in two fortnights' time.",
        "959": "In three fortnights' time thou art to be wed, so that should be sufficient. Thou hast arranged the church, the feast, the transport, the lodging- all?",
        "960": "Indeed, we have taken care of all. We decided not to be wed in a church, however, as neither of us is particularly devout.",
        "961": "In which inn shall the reception be held?",
        "962": "The Palace Hotel shall be hosting the feast and the wedding cake, I am assured that they shall do a magnificent job.",
        "963": "Ah, yes. 'Tis a most excellent inn. A friend of mine had her reception there and declared it was flawless, though steep in cost.",
        "964": "Indeed, it shall be costly, but we believe it shall be worth it. To know that the preparations for our reception are in the hands of experienced people gives us great comfort.",
        "965": "I believe thou hast made the right choice, my friend.",
        "966": "Hast thou a round-necked jumper?",
        "967": "Indeed. Our collection of jumpers is most extensive.",
        "968": "May I don this one for a try?",
        "969": "Of course, be my guest.",
        "970": "The hue is too bold for my age, I should prefer a lighter shade.",
        "971": "So Dick, shall we procure some coffee this eve?",
        "972": "Coffee? I have not a fondness for that sort of fare.",
        "973": "Come now, thou canst at least give it a try, alongside thy cigarette.",
        "974": "What is wrong with that? Cigarette is my madness.",
        "975": "Not for me, Dick.",
        "976": "Thou art charging me ten galleons for a motion picture I never ordered or viewed.",
        "977": "Allow me to consult your record, sir. It appears thou viewed 'Titanic' on Monday eve.",
        "978": "Well, the record hath an error. I was at a concert on Monday eve.",
        "979": "Thy word outweighs the record, sir. One moment, if you please.",
        "980": "I knew thou wouldst see it my way.",
        "981": "Sir, I have deleted the ten galleons, but I must add a two galleon service charge to thy bill.",
        "982": "Am I in the Twilight Zone? Thou art charging me for a motion picture I never viewed?",
        "983": "Do not hold me accountable, sir. Blame the wizard who wrote the code.",
        "984": "This is robbery on the highway! I shall summon the Aurors!",
        "985": "If it brings thee comfort, other guests have expressed similar sentiments.",
        "986": "Minister Carter has dispatched me to extend an invitation to attend a feast in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel, commencing at 7 PM this eve. Please allow me to present you with this invitation.",
        "987": "How gracious of him. I would be honored to attend. At what hour would you like me to be ready?",
        "988": "If you could have yourself prepared by 6:30 PM, I shall be waiting at the hotel to escort you.",
        "989": "That is wonderful news. Your thoughtfulness is greatly appreciated, Miss Rose.",
        "990": "It is my pleasure. Farewell for now.",
        "991": "Farewell until this evening, Miss Rose.",
        "992": "I desire an audience with Dr. Johnson.",
        "993": "Pardon me, but he is not present at the moment. May I assist you by taking a message?",
        "994": "This is Robert Jordan. Kindly request him to return my call, if you would be so kind.",
        "995": "Very well, I shall deliver the message.",
        "996": "Good day, sir. Might I have a glance at your passport?",
        "997": "Certainly, here you are.",
        "998": "Many thanks. Do these belong to you?",
        "999": "No, a portion of them belongs to my companion. Would you like me to present her passport as well?",
        "1000": "Indeed, please do. Do you have any hand-carried items?",
        "1001": "Shall I place them on the conveyor belt as well?",
        "1002": "Yes, if you would be so kind. Could you open this large suitcase for me?",
        "1003": "Very well. Just a moment. It contains nothing more than some garments and grooming supplies.",
        "1004": "Understood. Do you have anything to declare?",
        "1005": "I do not believe so.",
        "1006": "Do ye carry any fresh produce, live flora, or fauna with ye?",
        "1007": "Nay, none at all.",
        "1008": "Thank ye kindly. Ye may lock yer suitcase. Here be yer wizarding identification papers.",
        "1009": "Many thanks.",
        "1010": "Greetings. I purchased a garment from China at yer emporium this morn.",
        "1011": "Aye?",
        "1012": "I've acquired it in an overlarge size by accident.",
        "1013": "Oh, did ye now?",
        "1014": "Might ye be able to alter it to a size smaller?",
        "1015": "Indeed, of course. Might ye bring the receipt with ye?",
        "1016": "I'll visit yer establishment later this eve, and may I inquire about yer closing time?",
        "1017": "Our shop shall remain open until 8 bells in the evening, madam. We eagerly anticipate yer arrival.",
        "1018": "The headmaster announces the increase in wages today, aye? What is yer estimation of the amount we shall receive?",
        "1019": "I've no notion. Yer guess is as good as mine.",
        "1020": "It had best be more than last year.",
        "1021": "Indeed, anything is better than naught. Let us wait and see.",
        "1022": "I plan to venture forth and gather provisions for sustenance.",
        "1023": "Pray, do we require provisions?",
        "1024": "I believe we have run out of provisions to sustain us.",
        "1025": "Do ye have a list of items to procure?",
        "1026": "I'm not sure what provisions we require, wizard.",
        "1027": "Might I suggest you go and inspect the larder, wizard?",
        "1028": "I would be most grateful if you would take care of that for me, wizard.",
        "1029": "Why not simply secure the essentials, wizard?",
        "1030": "What do you mean, wizard?",
        "1031": "Eggs, milk, bread, things of that nature, wizard.",
        "1032": "Create that list, wizard.",
        "1033": "Of course, no trouble, wizard.",
        "1034": "Greetings, do take a seat. Let us get straight to business. This is our pact. Please read it thoroughly before affixing your signature.",
        "1035": "As we have reached an understanding on all terms, there should not be any obstacles for the pact.",
        "1036": "Allow me to remind you once more, the pact can be dissolved with a month's notice.",
        "1037": "Yes, I comprehend. Thank you.",
        "1038": "Pardon me, is this the baggage reclaim for flight KL17?",
        "1039": "Yes, how may I assist you?",
        "1040": "This is my baggage tag for reclaim. Might I have my belongings now?",
        "1041": "Very well, here you are.",
        "1042": "Many thanks.",
        "1043": "Did you manage to attend the basketball match on Friday night, wizard?",
        "1044": "I was unable to attend, wizard.",
        "1045": "You missed out, it was quite thrilling, wizard.",
        "1046": "Magical Assistance, is there anything I can cast a spell for you on?",
        "1047": "Yes, I am afraid there are not enough outlets for my wand.",
        "1048": "Well, we have 6 for each chamber.",
        "1049": "Yes, but 4 of them have been cursed. Can you send a wizard to repair them?",
        "1050": "OK, wizard, please wait a moment.",
        "1051": "Why did you stop me?",
        "1052": "Are you aware that you rode through a red stop spell?",
        "1053": "I ran a red stop spell?",
        "1054": "Yes, you did.",
        "1055": "I apologize, but I didn't realize that I did.",
        "1056": "Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down, not speed up?",
        "1057": "I was taught that.",
        "1058": "So, then why did you speed up?",
        "1059": "I don't know what to tell you.",
        "1060": "I'm going to have to issue you a citation.",
        "1061": "I understand.",
        "1062": "Here you go. Don't break wizarding laws again.",
        "1063": "Can I have the roll of enchanted film developed here?",
        "1064": "Certainly, wizard.",
        "1065": "Here is the enchanted film. Can I retrieve my pictures tomorrow?",
        "1066": "Is it so? Who emerged triumphant in the end?",
        "1067": "Our side claimed the victory.",
        "1068": "Alas, I was otherwise occupied that evening. I'm vexed I missed such a thrilling event.",
        "1069": "It was a magnificent match.",
        "1070": "What was the final score?",
        "1071": "Our team emerged victorious with a score of 101-98.",
        "1072": "It sounds as though it was a hard-fought match.",
        "1073": "That's precisely why it was such an unforgettable game.",
        "1074": "I shall certainly be in attendance for the next match.",
        "1075": "Have you ever indulged in online shopping?",
        "1076": "No, never. I prefer to examine what I'm purchasing before I hand over my coin, particularly in regards to garments and footwear.",
        "1077": "Indeed, seeing is believing.",
        "1078": "I've heard some individuals say that the items they receive are not what they expected after seeing them advertised on the internet.",
        "1079": "It's a common occurrence. Without proper inspection, one may fall prey to a scam and the shop may vanish without a trace.",
        "1080": "What's more, paying online poses a risk as Dark Wizards may steal one's username and password.",
        "1081": "I've heard that measures have been put in place to counter such dangers, but I still feel that it's not entirely safe. That's why I prefer shopping in the wizarding world's many shops.",
        "1082": "I couldn't agree more. That's why I only participate in shopping on the streets.",
        "1083": "As do I. I'll sometimes peruse online shops for information, then go to a physical store to complete the transaction.",
        "1084": "A wise course of action.",
        "1085": "How far is it to the center of town from here?",
        "1086": "It's a journey by broomstick that shall take fifteen minutes.",
        "1087": "What sort of wizarding establishments do we have nearby?",
        "1088": "The neighborhood is home to renowned wizarding companies such as Mitsubishi, HP, IBM and many others.",
        "1089": "Is the seventh floor also owned by our wizarding firm?",
        "1090": "Indeed, our wizarding firm has claimed both the sixth and seventh floors of this building as its own.",
        "1091": "Being such a grand firm, do we possess our own staff dining hall?",
        "1092": "Indeed, it can be found at the end of the corridor.",
        "1093": "Good morning, sir. How may I be of assistance?",
        "1094": "Good morning, I have a meeting scheduled with Mr. Johnson at 10:00.",
        "1095": "Forgive me, sir, but are you Mr. Richard of the World Trading Company?",
        "1096": "Indeed, I am.",
        "1097": "Apologies, Mr. Richard. Mr. Johnson is on his way to the office. He's just sent word that he'll be here soon and has asked you to wait a moment.",
        "1098": "Very well, I shall wait.",
        "1099": "May I offer you a drink, sir? Would you prefer coffee or tea?",
        "1100": "Many thanks. I would like coffee, please.",
        "1101": "Here you are, Mr. Richard. This is the cream, and here is the sugar. If there's anything else you require, do not hesitate to ask.",
        "1102": "Much obliged.",
        "1103": "Ministry of Magic emergency services, how may I assist you?",
        "1104": "I must report a break-in.",
        "1105": "At what time did this break-in occur?",
        "1106": "Last night the break-in was reported.",
        "1107": "Where was the home of the victim?",
        "1108": "It was the victim's own home that was broken into.",
        "1109": "Has anything been taken yet?",
        "1110": "The victim is not sure, as of yet.",
        "1111": "What led the victim to suspect a break-in?",
        "1112": "The front window of the victim's home had been shattered.",
        "1113": "A team of Aurors will be dispatched immediately.",
        "1114": "The victim is in need of haste.",
        "1115": "Good day, attendees. Allow me to introduce myself.",
        "1116": "Your introduction is unnecessary, Yang. Your reputation precedes you.",
        "1117": "Thank you, but I still thought I would attempt to chair this meeting in a traditional manner, at least for a while.",
        "1118": "Very well, let us proceed.",
        "1119": "I would like to commence proceedings. Today's primary focus is the creation of a U.S. sales strategy for the latest EBB model. I would like to hear all of your thoughts and suggestions. Mr. Wall, I understand you are particularly well-prepared today. Would you care to start us off?",
        "1120": "Of course, I believe we must keep in mind that effective advertising is the cornerstone of successful sales.",
        "1121": "That much is rather evident, is it not?",
        "1122": "Please be understanding, Yang.",
        "1123": "Shall we continue on with the discussion?",
        "1124": "I apologize, but I do not believe this issue can be attributed to our responsibility.",
        "1125": "Could you please elaborate?",
        "1126": "It appears the delivery service hath committed this deed.",
        "1127": "In that case, we ought to bring this matter to their attention forthwith.",
        "1128": "Greetings, Mr. Johnson. I am pleased thou hast found the time to meet with me. There is no finer setting for our discussion today, the ambiance in this place is delightful.",
        "1129": "Fear not, for I always make it a point to mix business with leisure when the opportunity presents itself. Now, pray tell, what more canst thou tell me about these confections thou art offering?",
        "1130": "Well, as thou art aware, I have recently become the exclusive distributor of Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons throughout the United States. They are a new manufacturer, seeking to make their mark in the luxury market. Thy restaurant immediately came to mind, as I believe it embodies many of the same qualities as Grangers. Adding these chocolates to thy menu shall further establish thy reputation for providing first-class, elegant, and luxurious dining.",
        "1131": "Hmmm, intriguing... Gourmet chocolates, are they produced in Belgium, perchance?",
        "1132": "Nay, the factory is located in Scotland.",
        "1133": "Truly? I was not aware Scotland was renowned for its luxury chocolate production.",
        "1134": "That is precisely what makes this such a remarkable opportunity! The government is fully supportive of creating new markets for exports and hath guaranteed a low tariff for wholesale orders of more than a thousand units. They have also streamlined the customs process. Here, I brought these specifically for thee. Try one!",
        "1135": "Oh, thank thee. Mmm, the texture is creamy, very smooth...",
        "1136": "Unusual, are they not? I wager thou hast never tasted anything like it! The quality is guaranteed, for I personally visit the factory to ensure that no shortcuts are taken with the ingredients. Only the finest make it through my inspection.",
        "1137": "Indeed, the flavors are most intriguing... Slightly spicy, quite unique. Pray tell, what exactly are the ingredients?",
        "1138": "I have it on the utmost authority that this traditional secret recipe hath been passed down through the Granger family for generations. I am confident thou canst keep a secret. Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar, and Haggis.",
        "1139": "Haggis? What is Haggis?",
        "1140": "It is a traditional Scottish delicacy. One stuffs sheep's liver, heart, and lung inside the sheep's stomach.",
        "1141": "Ah, I shall respond anon.",
        "1142": "Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson?",
        "1143": "Dost thou require a guide?",
        "1144": "Aye, we are seeking one. What is the daily fee?",
        "1145": "A mere 20 Galleons a day it is, and if ye plan on stayin' for more than three days in the city, 'twill be 16 Galleons per day.",
        "1146": "That seems fair, wizard.",
        "1147": "Are you not Jim Green, the wizard?",
        "1148": "Yes, I am Jim Green. Verily, it is I.",
        "1149": "I recall our meeting at a wizarding concert last year. I am Taylor, wizard of renown.",
        "1150": "Ah, yes, I remember now. Greetings, Taylor.",
        "1151": "Lucy, I wish to attend to the flickering light in the corridor, which hath been driving me mad. Would thou art willing to aid me with thy ladder?",
        "1152": "Monica, tarry for a moment. I think it would be best to summon a repair wizard to attend to the task.",
        "1153": "I am confident that I can handle it alone.",
        "1154": "I would like thee to peruse the safety manual of our wizarding company.",
        "1155": "I comprehend. If I were to be injured whilst fixing the light, even during office hours, I would not receive compensation from our wizarding company, as repairing is not my responsibility.",
        "1156": "Other wizarding company regulations also require your attention.",
        "1157": "Like this one? Never wear loose robes or untied hair when operating the shredder. Aye, thank thee for thy warning.",
        "1158": "Do not mention it, wizard.",
        "1159": "Huzzah! I have completed writing the service guide! It hath taken me an age!",
        "1160": "When didst thou complete the task?",
        "1161": "This morning! No more overtime, and no more headaches!",
        "1162": "Well, I am glad to hear it. Wouldst thou care for a cup of wizarding coffee?",
        "1163": "I did not receive an unemployment stipend this week and must know the reason why.",
        "1164": "Didst thou send us thy last Continued Claim Form, wizard?",
        "1165": "I fear I may have forgotten to send it in.",
        "1166": "If thou dost not turn in the Continued Claim Form every fortnight, we cannot remunerate thee.",
        "1167": "Can it still be sent by post if it be more than fourteen days late?",
        "1168": "If it be no more than two weeks past due, we shall still accept it.",
        "1169": "I shall make certain to send it sooner next time so as to avoid such issues.",
        "1170": "Thou canst not predict thy work schedule in advance. If thou sendeth it too soon, it shall be rejected!",
        "1171": "Shall my wages arrive belatedly due to my error in the form?",
        "1172": "Thy pay shall arrive late, but the next shall arrive promptly.",
        "1173": "I must inform thee that I shall be departing in thirty minutes' time.",
        "1174": "I am prepared when thou art, sir.",
        "1175": "Excellent! The clock hath just struck nine in New York.",
        "1176": "Thou art correct, sir. Just now it hath become nine o'clock.",
        "1177": "I shall spend some time exploring the city. What should I do with my baggage?",
        "1178": "Here, sir, we have a storage site for thy belongings at the cost of five galleons per hour, but a deposit is required.",
        "1179": "A deposit? Are my belongings not enough of a deposit?",
        "1180": "Apologies, sir, but they are not. Thy MasterCard or VISA shall suffice.",
        "1181": "Very well. I shall consider it.",
        "1182": "Very well, sir, but tarry not too long. Thou hast but thirty minutes.",
        "1183": "May I take thy order?",
        "1184": "Aye, I would like a bowl of onion soup, if thou please.",
        "1185": "And what would thou like after that?",
        "1186": "Pray, I should like the roasted fowl, if you would be so kind.",
        "1187": "It is the latest fashion, particularly amongst the young witches and wizards.",
        "1188": "Indeed, I am aware, and I find it quite charming. I shall partake.",
        "1189": "Very good. Here is your bill, sir or madam.",
        "1190": "Might I inquire as to the length of the guarantee for this communication device?",
        "1191": "You may return it for a full refund within seven days or exchange it for a new one within a year's time.",
        "1192": "Greetings, my love. How was your day today?",
        "1193": "It was passable. I ran into Bill and we chatted for a spell. He seems to have gotten himself into a bit of trouble.",
        "1194": "Oh? What has happened?",
        "1195": "Well, it seems his son has had an unfortunate mishap, and Bill has no medical coverage. This news has made me ponder, and I have begun to wonder if we shouldn't consider the services of a wizarding HMO.",
        "1196": "Indeed, you are correct. We are not getting any younger, and our children will soon be in need of our care.",
        "1197": "Precisely! I scoured the wizarding web and found a few HMOs with reasonable co-payments and excellent coverage. The deductibles are quite low as well.",
        "1198": "That sounds promising, although I do wonder if we shall be eligible for such coverage. The wizarding insurance companies can be quite mercenary.",
        "1199": "Well, as we have no pre-existing conditions or afflictions, I am confident that we shall be accepted.",
        "1200": "It is a shame that our place of employment or our wizarding community do not provide us with proper medical coverage.",
        "1201": "Indeed, not in a million years!",
        "1202": "Greetings. Might you be so kind as to inform me of the steps one must take in order to apply for a position?",
        "1203": "Of course, there are many steps involved. You may submit your application through the wizarding web and then send your curriculum vitae to the company's owl post. Then, you must await their reply.",
        "1204": "Might I ask what qualifications are required for the position?",
        "1205": "You must have a minimum of two years experience in the field.",
        "1206": "What was the outcome of your day's endeavors, my friend?",
        "1207": "I engaged in a game of wizard's poker with my colleagues from the Ministry of Magic.",
        "1208": "Did fortune smile upon you this day?",
        "1209": "Indeed, success was mine.",
        "1210": "I seek to retrieve a portion of my savings stored within my wizarding account.",
        "1211": "Might I request a glimpse of your wizarding ledger and the form for withdrawal, if you please?",
        "1212": "Of course, here you are.",
        "1213": "Let me just verify, you desire to withdraw the sum of one thousand wizarding galleons?",
        "1214": "Precisely so.",
        "1215": "May I inspect that magical camera, if you don't mind?",
        "1216": "Certainly, this is a particularly fine piece of magical technology.",
        "1217": "What is the cost for this device?",
        "1218": "This particular model is valued at 1500 wizarding knuts.",
        "1219": "It appears to be a fine specimen. I believe I shall purchase it.",
        "1220": "Might I interest you in any additional items?",
        "1221": "No, thank you, that shall be all.",
        "1222": "I require a beverage to wash down my meal. Is there any juice available within the refrigerator?",
        "1223": "What is this revolting concoction before me? It appears to have originated from the depths of a bog!",
        "1224": "It is a potion of a green hue, touted to contain numerous vitamins and minerals.",
        "1225": "One needn't sacrifice taste in the pursuit of a healthy diet, my friend.",
        "1226": "The apothecary said that even if I consume the proper potions, I may still not receive the necessary vitamins.",
        "1227": "Have you tested this yourself, or do you simply trust the apothecary's words?",
        "1228": "It is much simpler to drink this tonic once a day, instead of constantly imbibing fruits and vegetables.",
        "1229": "While it may be more expeditious, I'm not so sure about easier. This tonic looks quite unappetizing.",
        "1230": "Billy, tardiness strikes again.",
        "1231": "My apologies for my lateness. I overslept. Is the Headmaster in today?",
        "1232": "Indeed, he is within his office at this moment.",
        "1233": "Oh, I hope he did not observe my arrival.",
        "1234": "Do not take any risks. It would be best if you faced the Headmaster and offered your apologies. He is already displeased with your previous two incidents of tardiness. Any further instances may result in your expulsion.",
        "1235": "You are quite correct. It shall not happen again. Do you truly believe the Headmaster would expel me?",
        "1236": "I fear he might. You should go to his office without delay.",
        "1237": "You are likely correct. I shall go immediately and offer my apologies. It can be quite a challenge to navigate the streets of Hogsmeade, especially during rush hour.",
        "1238": "Good fortune be with you!",
        "1239": "What is the cost of the quarters?",
        "1240": "The monthly rent for the quarters is 1500 galleons.",
        "1241": "And what is the deposit?",
        "1242": "The deposit is a fee of 500 galleons.",
        "1243": "Is there anything else, aside from the credit ranking and debt-to-asset ratio?",
        "1244": "One must also take into account the balance of net liabilities. It must not surpass the net assets, and there can be no recorded losses in the business in the past two years.",
        "1245": "Understood. This should not present an issue.",
        "1246": "The rate of return on assets must not fall below the average for the industry during the first half of the year.",
        "1247": "As far as I can tell, we meet the criteria.",
        "1248": "Of course, we must provide proof and duplicate copies of all necessary documents. Once we've presented the evidence, the assessment should proceed quickly.",
        "1249": "Do you know any languages besides English?",
        "1250": "I have a limited understanding of Japanese, which shares many similarities with Chinese culture and language.",
        "1251": "What level did you attain on the Japanese Language Proficiency Test?",
        "1252": "I achieved Band 2 on the test, but I hope to reach the highest level, Band 1, in the future.",
        "1253": "What seems to be the issue, Mr. Brown?",
        "1254": "I'm not feeling well, Doctor Ford.",
        "1255": "In what way?",
        "1256": "I've lost my appetite, always tired, and have trouble sleeping.",
        "1257": "Have you lost weight?",
        "1258": "Yes, I've lost quite a bit of weight over the past month.",
        "1259": "When was the last time you were checked by a doctor?",
        "1260": "About two months ago.",
        "1261": "Let me take your blood pressure. You appear pale. Don't worry, Mr. Brown, it's nothing serious. You're just a bit run down from overworking.",
        "1262": "What should I do?",
        "1263": "A vacation would likely do you good. Try to get outside more and get some rest. That should help.",
        "1264": "Thank you, Doctor. I'll follow your advice.",
        "1265": "May I see your wizarding passport, please?",
        "1266": "Aye, I can.",
        "1267": "Additionally, I would like two copies of each of the spell-stills.",
        "1268": "Do tell me about yourself, if you please.",
        "1269": "My name is Dunlin and I hail from Beijing. I was born in the year of the dragon, 1980. I shall be graduating from Peking University this July, with a specialization in the art of accounting.",
        "1270": "Might you also share some details about your kin?",
        "1271": "I come from a small family of three, myself, my father who is a professor of magic, and my mother who is a skilled artisan.",
        "1272": "It is high time I start nourishing myself with wholesome ingredients.",
        "1273": "Aye, 'tis true. I too must start making better choices in my meals.",
        "1274": "What manner of food do you typically partake in?",
        "1275": "I do my utmost to only consume fruits, vegetables, and lean cuts of enchanted chicken.",
        "1276": "Is that truly all that goes into your cauldron?",
        "1277": "Indeed, for the most part.",
        "1278": "How do you manage to stick to such a limited diet?",
        "1279": "Fruits, vegetables, and magical creatures such as chicken, are known to be highly nutritious and beneficial to the body and soul.",
        "1280": "Aye, but what of the enchanted chicken?",
        "1281": "I mostly consume baked chicken, as it is prepared in a manner that retains its nutritional properties and is relatively low in unhealthy substances.",
        "1282": "That does sound rather palatable.",
        "1283": "Indeed it does, for it is both wholesome and satisfying.",
        "1284": "Good day to you! Might I be of assistance?",
        "1285": "Would you be so kind as to direct me to the aisle housing the robes of the Chinese persuasion? I am in search of a silken cloak.",
        "1286": "Of course, here is my passport.",
        "1287": "I take it you are here for the German delegation's business, correct?",
        "1288": "Indeed, I was invited by a German company for some business discussions.",
        "1289": "For how long will you be residing in our fair land?",
        "1290": "Just for two weeks, nothing too long.",
        "1291": "How many pieces of luggage have you brought with you?",
        "1292": "Just one, my trusty camera.",
        "1293": "Do you have plans to remove it upon your departure?",
        "1294": "I do, indeed.",
        "1295": "Per the regulations, your camera is allowed to stay with you during your time here duty-free, but it must be removed upon leaving our country.",
        "1296": "I shall comply with these regulations.",
        "1297": "Well then, may your stay in Germany be filled with pleasant experiences.",
        "1298": "My thanks to you.",
        "1299": "Excuse me, what should I include in my Curriculum Vitae?",
        "1300": "Typically, a CV or resume should include six elements: personal information, educational background, practical experience, personal skills, self-evaluation, and career aspirations.",
        "1301": "What kind of personal information is required?",
        "1302": "Such information as your name, gender, date of birth, height, and contact information, among others.",
        "1303": "May I enter?",
        "1304": "Indeed, come in. I am the Director of Personnel, Mr. Peter. How may I assist you?",
        "1305": "It is a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Peter. I am Wang Sian, and I am here for the interview as previously arranged.",
        "1306": "Greetings, Miss Wang. How do you fare this fine day? Please, do have a seat.",
        "1307": "Many thanks.",
        "1308": "In which subject did you specialize during your education, if I may inquire?",
        "1309": "I studied Public Relations at the wizarding school of my choice.",
        "1310": "Have you put your education to use in the work world?",
        "1311": "Indeed I have, sir. After graduation, I spent a year working in the export section of a trade company located in the wizarding city of Macao.",
        "1312": "What sorts of duties were you responsible for in that position?",
        "1313": "My responsibilities included overseeing the successful export of various wizarding goods and products.",
        "1314": "Fascinating, you must have a good understanding of the complexities of export procedures.",
        "1315": "Indeed, I do, sir.",
        "1316": "Splendid. That will certainly come in useful.",
        "1317": "Where to, madam?",
        "1318": "To the Grand Hotel, if you please.",
        "1319": "The Grand Hotel, you say?",
        "1320": "Correct, do you know its location?",
        "1321": "I'm afraid not, madam. I do not believe I am familiar with its location.",
        "1322": "It can be found on 11th Avenue, at the end of Park Street.",
        "1323": "Ah, yes! I know the location well now.",
        "1324": "Might I take your order now, madam?",
        "1325": "Indeed, I'll start with a serving of the shrimp cocktail, if you please.",
        "1326": "What would you like for your main course, wizard?",
        "1327": "I'll have a steak, medium rare, please.",
        "1328": "Do you have any reading material, wizard?",
        "1329": "Yes, I do have some.",
        "1330": "Could I borrow one, wizard?",
        "1331": "Of course, here you go.",
        "1332": "Thank you. It's quite chilly this morning, isn't it?",
        "1333": "You're not wrong there.",
        "1334": "Have you heard any news, wizard?",
        "1335": "Which news are you referring to?",
        "1336": "Brazil won the World Cup.",
        "1337": "I see, indeed.",
        "1338": "We have an orientation this afternoon.",
        "1339": "What will be covered during the orientation?",
        "1340": "The company introduction, our mission and vision, various policies, insurance, pension plan, company ID, batch, telephone, email set-up, and training.",
        "1341": "That's quite a lot. All of that in one afternoon?",
        "1342": "Yes, it won't be easy.",
        "1343": "I'm OK with it. I like being busy and learning new things.",
        "1344": "Excuse me, wizard, could you please guide me to the human resources department?",
        "1345": "Of course, but have you made an appointment beforehand?",
        "1346": "Greetings, I am Monica. I have an appointment with your HR manager.",
        "1347": "One moment, if you please. I shall make a call to the HR office. Yes, they confirm your appointment. Please come in. The HR department is located on the 3rd floor, room 3106. You may take the right elevator, as the left one is undergoing maintenance today.",
        "1348": "Many thanks.",
        "1349": "You're quite welcome.",
        "1350": "When shall we expect the finished product from you?",
        "1351": "We anticipate having it completed by the end of next week.",
        "1352": "Fantastic! That will be ahead of schedule. Well done!",
        "1353": "Indeed, as the saying goes, we strive to exceed expectations.",
        "1354": "Do you happen to have any cheaper alternatives?",
        "1355": "Yes, we have a few options on special sale at present.",
        "1356": "That's much more reasonable. I'll take this one, then.",
        "1357": "Good morning, how may I assist you today?",
        "1358": "I am searching for a pair of earrings to give to my wife as an anniversary gift.",
        "1359": "You have come to the correct establishment. We have a magnificent array of earrings for you to select from.",
        "1360": "I noticed a pair of earrings in your window display. Might I have a closer look?",
        "1361": "Do you refer to the dazzling pearl earrings?",
        "1362": "Indeed, how much are they?",
        "1363": "They are priced at three thousand yuan.",
        "1364": "What is the setting made of?",
        "1365": "The setting, sir, is crafted from a unique platinum alloy, ensuring its luster will never fade.",
        "1366": "By Merlin's beard, I shall take them. Please package them and provide me with the parchment.",
        "1367": "A wise decision, sir. An excellent choice.",
        "1368": "Room service, I say!",
        "1369": "Good morning, 'tis room 113 speaking. I require breakfast, pronto.",
        "1370": "Very good, Mrs. Jones?",
        "1371": "That is correct.",
        "1372": "How can I be of assistance?",
        "1373": "I would like a goblet of grapefruit juice, a jar of marmalade, a plate of scrambled eggs and sausages, a loaf of toast, and a cauldron of black coffee, if you please. How long until it arrives?",
        "1374": "Only a matter of moments, madam.",
        "1375": "Marvelous, I am grateful.",
        "1376": "Greetings, Sam. I seek to purchase a companion. Have you any suggestions?",
        "1377": "Rachel's pet emporium is where you should go.",
        "1378": "And why is that, pray tell?",
        "1379": "It's beyond special. One may find any manner of creature they can think to name, and more.",
        "1380": "Is that so? Are there serpents within?",
        "1381": "Serpents? Ha! There are even rodents and primates! A world of exotic creatures to choose from.",
        "1382": "Fantastic, I cannot wait to visit.",
        "1383": "Wait, are you certain that you wish to keep a non-traditional companion?",
        "1384": "Why not? 'Tis quite cool.",
        "1385": "But it may pose a hazard to your health, friend.",
        "1386": "Excuse me?",
        "1387": "Many reptiles carry potentially dangerous bacteria that may pose a risk to one's health.",
        "1388": "Ah, I was not aware of that.",
        "1389": "It might not be the safest option for families, especially those with young children, to keep such pets.",
        "1390": "Oh, I hadn't thought about my brother's infant daughter. Perhaps a canine companion would be a better fit for me.",
        "1391": "Good luck in your decision, Maria.",
        "1392": "Greetings, this is room 1205. Our message light is flashing.",
        "1393": "One moment, if you please.",
        "1394": "Many thanks.",
        "1395": "I apologize for the delay. Mr. Johns requires a call from you.",
        "1396": "Might you bring the message to my quarters?",
        "1397": "Unfortunately, we have no available messenger at present.",
        "1398": "Then I shall come down and retrieve the message posthaste.",
        "1399": "Understood, we shall be waiting for you.",
        "1400": "Care to hazard a guess? I've received some exciting news!",
        "1401": "Pray tell, what is it?",
        "1402": "As you are aware, I've been working as a proof-reader at The Economist, correct?",
        "1403": "Indeed.",
        "1404": "The editor-in-chief took note of my previous experience as an editor at another publication and has offered me the position of assistant editor.",
        "1405": "Really? How wonderful! Will you have the opportunity to put quill to parchment?",
        "1406": "She announced that the scribe of the literary commentary would soon be departing on a maternity leave, and that I might take up the quill until her return.",
        "1407": "Wow! That is indeed news to be celebrated. How often does the periodical see print?",
        "1408": "It's a monthly publication, yet I must share the space with another scribe, so I must pen my articles bi-weekly.",
        "1409": "Are you eager to delve deeper into the editing work?",
        "1410": "Indeed, but my excitement is greater still at the prospect of having my musings published once more!",
        "1411": "Do you have any parchment to order a subscription to the magazine?",
        "1412": "Alas, I do not, but I believe I might be able to bring a complimentary copy home for you.",
        "1413": "I eagerly anticipate reading your commentary.",
        "1414": "As do I. Shall we go out to celebrate this good news?",
        "1415": "Of course, where might you suggest we go?",
        "1416": "Perhaps we could attend the library festival that is being held at the local bookseller's?",
        "1417": "Have you seen the new issue of Cosmo that I perused this morn?",
        "1418": "I believe I did spy it upon the kitchen table.",
        "1419": "Indeed, my thanks. There is an intriguing interview with a prominent director regarding his latest motion picture that I must finish reading.",
        "1420": "And who is this director?",
        "1421": "It is none other than Martin Scorsese. Did you not enjoy his film, 'The Departed'?",
        "1422": "I did, it was grand! Might I read the interview when you have finished?",
        "1423": "Of course. You know, it is also available in the online edition. If you are eager to read it now, you might peruse it there.",
        "1424": "That is kind, but I shall wait. Out of curiosity, do you subscribe to this periodical?",
        "1425": "No, I do not. I do not frequent it enough for a subscription to be justified.",
        "1426": "How much does The Daily Prophet cost?",
        "1427": "It's nearly three Galleons now, and I've heard whispers that the price may be raised to four Galleons soon.",
        "1428": "That seems quite steep. Who is their target audience?",
        "1429": "The Daily Prophet primarily caters to the wizarding middle class, though I fear that if the price rises too much, their circulation will drop significantly.",
        "1430": "I'll wager that you'll still purchase it, though. You couldn't possibly be without your wizarding news and gossip!",
        "1431": "Ha! This is a rare occasion indeed, you've not haggled!",
        "1432": "Haggle? I wouldn't want to feel guilty for trying to save a few Sickles.",
        "1433": "But you could have saved some money.",
        "1434": "For what? A few sickles? No, it's not worth it. Plus, I'd happily pay more for access to the latest wizarding news and events.",
        "1435": "For your information, there is a magical market nearby. But perhaps you're done shopping for the day...",
        "1436": "Ha! I've only just begun! Please take me there at once!",
        "1437": "Can you assist me in conducting a wizarding search?",
        "1438": "Of course. What would you like to find?",
        "1439": "I wish to learn more about the First Wizarding War.",
        "1440": "Ah, might I ask for a bit more specificity? There are many records and accounts of that war.",
        "1441": "Yes, I would like to know more about the Battle of Hogwarts.",
        "1442": "Very well. You may use the Wizarding Wireless Network, simply type in 'Battle of Hogwarts.'",
        "1443": "My word, there are a multitude of results.",
        "1444": "Here, try this one. It's a reliable source of information about the Battle of Hogwarts.",
        "1445": "Thank you.",
        "1446": "For a more comprehensive understanding, I suggest perusing a historical tome.",
        "1447": "Many thanks. I shall visit the wizarding library if I desire to know more.",
        "1448": "I must take a brief respite from my studies. I have been cooped up within these walls for too long.",
        "1449": "Understood. Please do return in two hours' time.",
        "1450": "Good day. I seek an audience with Tom Smith.",
        "1451": "I'm afraid he is unavailable at his desk at the moment.",
        "1452": "Do you have a notion of when he will return?",
        "1453": "Tom is away on a wizarding business journey and shall not return until sometime next week.",
        "1454": "Is there a means by which I may contact him?",
        "1455": "The best way to reach him would be through his wand. Let me give you his number.",
        "1456": "Thank you. Might I also inquire about his owl post address, just in case?",
        "1457": "Of course. His wand number is 09112223 33, and his owl post address is t.smith@ccw.com.tw.",
        "1458": "Thank you so kindly. Does he regularly check his correspondence?",
        "1459": "Indeed, he is quite prompt in responding to his messages.",
        "1460": "Splendid. Thank you once again for your assistance. You have been most helpful.",
        "1461": "It was my pleasure. I hope you are able to reach him.",
        "1462": "Pray tell, what seems to be the matter, Mr. Brown?",
        "1463": "I am not well, Dr. Ford. I am in a sorry state.",
        "1464": "Oh, in what way do you feel unwell?",
        "1465": "I have lost my appetite, feel constantly uneasy, and cannot sleep properly.",
        "1466": "Hast thou shed any pounds, my friend?",
        "1467": "Aye, I have indeed dropped a fair number of stones since last moon.",
        "1468": "When was the last time thou visited the healer?",
        "1469": "It was two moons past.",
        "1470": "Allow me to take thy blood pressure. Thou dost appear pale.",
        "1471": "Fear not, Mr. Brown, 'tis nothing of great concern.",
        "1472": "Thou art simply a bit worn out from over exertion.",
        "1473": "What am I to do, healer?",
        "1474": "A holiday would do thee wonders, I believe.",
        "1475": "Try to spend more time in the open air and ensure thou get enough rest.",
        "1476": "Thank thee, healer. I shall follow thy advice.",
        "1477": "Good morrow, Angela. How hast thou been of late?",
        "1478": "Mornin', Michael. I have been most busy as of late. One of our suppliers is closing shop, and I have been searching for a worthy replacement.",
        "1479": "Fear not, Angela. Thou canst always count on us to be here for the long haul. Care for a seat and a cuppa?",
        "1480": "Nay, thank thee. I have been trying to cut down on the caffeine.",
        "1481": "Ha, I could never do that. I would be a zombie without my morning coffee. Let us then get down to business.",
        "1482": "Aye. I have come to discuss the ordering of eight megapixel cameras for our new methone. The demand for such devices is growing, and Pear has fallen behind in the market.",
        "1483": "Marvelous news! I am glad Pear has finally joined the fray. Currently, our agreement is for five megapixel cameras. Is Pear still interested in obtaining such devices?",
        "1484": "Nay, we have changed all cameras to eight megapixels. We had hoped that by making thy company our sole supplier for cameras, we could negotiate a better agreement.",
        "1485": "Indeed. Let us then draft a new agreement."
