Coffee place.
Ted: So, I guess that decides it.
Marshall: Yup.
Barney: Hanging out at a coffee place is not nearly as much fun as hanging out at a bar.
Ted: Man, what's that?
Marshall: What?
Ted: That cute coffee girl wrote a heart by your name. Somebody has a crush on you.
Barney: Somebody thinks you're me.
Marshall: Do you really think she likes me? I mean, I guess it's not that surprising. Every time I come in here, I totally crack her up.
[FLASHBACK. Three weeks ago.]
Coffee girl: Marshall, here's your pumpkin latte.
Marshall: Wow. How did you fit a pumpkin in this little cup?
Man: I'll have a pumpkin latte.
Marshall: How do they even fit a pumpkin in those little cups? What? You got a shrink ray back there? Yeah.
Marshall: Hey, remember that time I said that thing about how do they fit a pumpkin into that little cup?
Coffee girl: Which time?
Marshall: The first time.
Coffee girl: Yeah. That was really funny.
Marshall: Right?
[END OF FLASHBACK]
Ted: All right, there's only two reasons she'd laugh at that. One, it's the first joke she's ever heard, or two, she likes you. You should totally ask her out.
Marshall: You think?
Ted: Yeah, that's why you're not back with Lily, right? So you can experience what it's like to be single.
Marshall: Well, what if the heart doesn't mean anything? What if she writes it on all the cups?
Ted: Mine says "Ted," no heart.
Barney: Mine says... "Swarley." How'd they get "Swarley" from "Barney"? It's not even a name. Who would ever be called "Swarley"? Oh, please don't start calling me "Swarley." This would never happen at a bar! 
Ted: Man! What's up with Swarley?
Marshall: I know. You almost never see old Swarlz get that upset.

Robin's apartment, Robin is on the phone.
Ted: Hey, guess what? Oh, sorry.
Robin: It's only my mom. She's just rambling on like always. What happened?
Ted: Marshall asked out a girl.
Robin: Wow.  Well, if anything, that's Dad's fault. That'll keep her going a while.
Ted: Oh, of course, you know, he had a little help.
Robin: Swarley hooked him up?
Ted: Oh, good. You got my text.
Robin: Yeah.
Ted: Oh. No, it was me. I gave Marshall one of my secrets.
[FLASHBACK]
Ted: So, what she say?
Marshall: Nothing. I don't think she heard me. It's pretty busy up there.
Ted: What? You gave her the look right? Head down, eyes looking up, hands in pockets, shoulders up, head slightly tilted, conveying shy vulnerability.
Marshall: I think so. Look, can we just go?
Coffee guy: Pumpkin latte for Marshall.
Marshall: I didn't order that. Phone number.
[END OF FLASHBACK]
Robin: I love that look. I think I slept with you because of that look. And it's fake?
Ted: Oh, and you biting your lower lip, shyly looking away and thrusting your chest out is natural?
Robin: Yeah, I hear you.
Ted : Hey!
Lily: Hey, guys. Are you free tomorrow night? I was thinking of having a wine tasting slash "help me catch the rat in my apartment" party.
Ted: That's a great idea. You can put out cheese for both.
Lily: I should invite Marshall, right? It'd be weird if I didn't.
Ted: Yeah, I don't think he can go.
Lily: Really? Why not?
Robin: Uh, okay, um... Lily, we have to tell you something. Marshall has a date.
Lily: Oh. Well... good for him.
Ted: Really? You're okay with it?
Lily: Look, we've been broken up almost six months. I mean, I'm not thrilled about the idea, but he has every right to date someone else.
Robin: That's very mature.
Lily: Why are you holding the phone?
Robin: Oh, sh**t.  That's hilarious, Mom. Didn't even notice.
MacLaren's.
Ted: Hey, dude, by the way, I really like that suit. Tell me about the fabric. Is it foreign or something?
Barney: Wow. It is foreign. I'm impressed, Ted. It's Moroccan, actually.
Ted: Whoa.
Carl: I got a call for Swarley. Is there a Swarley here?
Barney: You weren't interested in my suit at all, were you?
Carl: Swarley!
Ted : Yeah, I know he's there. It's really important. Could you ask again?
Carl: Important call for Swarley!
Marshall : Geez, can't you hear him, Swarley? There's a call for you.
Barney: Stop calling me that.
Marshall: Uh... Hey, I'd like you guys to officially meet Chloe.
Ted: Hi.
Barney: Hi.
Chloe: Hi. It's nice to meet you guys. I'll be right back.
Marshall: It's right back there. Right? Right? She's hot! And she likes me? She likes Italian food. I also like Italian food. She likes Billy Joel. I also like... music. And I think we're going to go out again.
Barney: Dude, you gotta ditch her.
Ted: Obviously.
Marshall: Why?
Barney: She's got the crazy eyes.
Ted: Dude. The eyes. They're crazy.
Marshall: What are you guys talking about, the crazy eyes?
Barney: It's a well-documented condition of the pupils, or pupi.
Ted: No. Just pupils.
Barney: It's an indicator of future mental instability.
Marshall: She does not have the crazy eyes.
Ted: You just can't see it because you're afflicted with "haven't been laid in a while" blindness.
Barney: She was too far away in the coffee place, but when I saw her up close just now...
[FLASHBACK]
Marshall: Hey, I'd like you guys to officially meet Chloe.
Ted: Hi.
Barney: Hi.
Chloe: Hi.  It's nice to meet you guys.
[END OF FLASHBACK]
Marshall: Guys, I'm not going to stop dating Chloe just because you think she has the crazy eyes.
Barney: You can keep going out with her, but you're gonna regret it. One time, I met a girl at this very bar. I saw that she had the crazy eyes... But I ignored it. And then, sure enough.
[FLASHBACK. Girl's bedroom]
Girl: Barney, can I ask you a question?
Barney: Anything.
Girl: Would you like to have a threesome?
Barney: Of course.
Girl: Great. It'll be you, me and Mr. Weasels.
[END OF FLASHBACK]
Ted: So, did you do it?
Barney: No. It ended up being just a twosome with the third one watching from a chair.
Ted: Which one were you?
Barney: I'd rather not say.
Ted: Look, there was a time I didn't believe in the crazy eyes either, and then I met Jeanine. She had serious crazy eyes. I told myself I was just imagining it, but then...
[FLASHBACK. In a street]
Ted: So, should we go get a drink?
Jeanine: As long as it's in your apartment. 
Driver: Whoa, I'm sorry.
Jeanine  So, where do you live?
[END OF FLASHBACK]
Marshall: You guys, Chloe is not  gonna do any of that stuff. She's a nice girl from Nebraska. She's not crazy. She's... she's awesome.
Ted from 2030: But you can't avoid the crazy eyes forever. Sooner or later, the crazy  comes bubbling to the surface.
Marshall's school law.
Marshall : Hello?
Chloe: Marshall, it's Chloe.
Marshall: Are you the one who's called me like nine times?
Chloe: Yeah. Could you come get me?
Marshall: I'm in the middle of taking a test.
Chloe: Please. I'm so scared.
Marshall: Well, what's going on?
Chloe: This weird midget guy started following me  and he was screaming at me and he had a limp and a big hump on his back and the police didn't believe me and I almost got trampled by a horse and... God I must sound totally crazy to you right now.
Marshall: No. Pfft. Not at all.
MacLaren's.
Ted: So, she's needy crazy. That's one of the worst kinds.
Barney: I've had one of those. Makes up stories to get attention. Went out with her for three weeks, her dad died twice.
Marshall: Guys, she was really freaked out, okay? Maybe the story is true.
Barney: What in the world would make you believe that's a true story?
Marshall: She's really hot.
Barney: They always are.
Wendy: You all done with that, Ted?
Ted: Yeah.
Barney: Ned. I told you to call him Ned.
Ted: That's just sad.
Wendy: Sorry, Swarley.
The apartment.
Chloe: So, do just you and Ted live here or does Swarley live here, too?
Marshall: Nah. Swarley has his own place.  What was that?
Chloe: Oh, I, uh, dropped my keys.
Marshall: So, here you go. Two pumpkin beers. I was joking. They're regular beers. What is that? This picture is broken.
Chloe: Oh. That's too bad. Is that Lily? Is that the girl you were going to marry?
Marshall: Yeah. Is that what that sound was? Did you just smash this?
Chloe: No. Why would I do that?
Marshall: Let me look into your eyes.
Chloe: Okay. I had a really nice time tonight.
Marshall: Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.
Chloe: I like your eyes a lot, too.
Lily : Stooooop! Hi. I'm Lily.
Lily: Stooooop!
Ted from 2030: Now, kids, I know Lily hiding in the apartment while Marshall was on a date with another girl seems pretty crazy, but when you hear her side of the story, well, it's still pretty crazy.
MacLaren's, 3 days earlier.
Robin: What's up Swarlz?
Barney: No. Okay? No. No more. I will not let this become a thing. It's over. No more Swarley. No Swarlz. No more Swar-lay. No more Swar... wait for it... ley. No more Bob Swarley, man. No more. No! It's over. Do you understand?
Robin: Yes.
Lily: Yes.
Barney: Thank you. 
Robin: Nice.
Lily: Why didn't you call me?
Robin: Was I supposed to call you?
Lily: Yes, about the whole Marshall-dating-another-girl thing.
Robin: You said you were fine with it.
Lily: Yeah, in front of Ted, but then I sh*t you a look.
Robin: What look?
Lily: This.
Robin: That doesn't seem like a look.
Lily: Yes it is. It means,  "I'm upset call me later."
Robin: You should have pulled me aside and told me what the look meant.
Lily: If I pulled you aside, I wouldn't need the look.
Robin: Well, maybe if it was a more distinctive look...
Lily: Okay, the look isn't important. What's important is that I can't stand the idea of Marshall dating another woman. I mean, what if he falls in love with her?
Robin: Well, if it makes you feel any better, Ted says she has the crazy eyes.
Lily: What's that?
Robin: Apparently, a thing women have that guys can see and it tells them that the girl's crazy.
Lily: Oh, kind of like how you never want to date a guy with perfect fingernails?
Robin: Jerk nails. Exactly.
Lily: Well, did Ted say whether she was good-looking? I mean, 'cause if I knew she was ugly, then maybe I wouldn't be so freaked out.
Robin: Uh, he didn't say, but you can find out. I think her name is Chloe, she works at Cosa Coffee on 78th.
Carl: Phone call for Swarles Barkley?
Robin : Hey, Ted. No, he's not here. Good one, though, remember that one.
;
Coffee place.
Lily: Is, um, Chloe here?
Coffee guy: She just left. You can probably still catch her. She's easy to spot, she's got a pink umbrella.
Lily: Oh, thanks, Brian.
Coffee guy: My name is Scott.
Lily: Your tag says Brian.
Coffee guy: I know. Funny story. So, I wake up this morning, and...
Lily: Yeah, see you later, Brian. 
MacLaren's.
Robin: She's hot? I'm so sorry.
Lily: No, it's fine. It just makes things easier. Now that I know she's a threat, all I have to do is keep Marshall from ever seeing her again. Okay, I have two plans, you can help me choose. Plan A) remember that time Marshall and I had sex in the bathroom? Oops, I got knocked up.
Robin: Lily.
Lily: Okay, plan B) is called "Chloe's Accident."
Robin: Just stop.
Lily: What?
Robin: Lily, you can't do any of those things. If you two are ever gonna get back together, you have to let him work out whatever this is.
Lily: I know. You're right.
Robin: Now, come on, Ted asked us to be upstairs at 6:00. Some surprise for Barney.
Lily: Barney?
Robin: Uh, Swarley.
The apartment.
Ted: Hey, guys.
Lily: Hey. Where's Marshall?
Ted: Oh, he's getting a haircut.
Lily: Oh. For his date. Good for him. Hope he has a good time tonight.
Barney: Relax, you've got nothing to worry about. The girl's crazy.
Lily: Thanks!
Barney: He'll just have wild monkey sex with her five times, max, and be done with her.
Lily: Thanks again.
Barney: What are you doing?
Ted: I just wanted to listen to a little music, that's all.
Radio speaker: And this next one's going out to Swarley. All your friends know you miss Barney, but he's gone, and you got to accept that, baby. And, Swarley, you're gonna be  a better woman for it. Here's "I Am Woman" by Helen Reddy.
Barney: Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman. I love it! You know, I was thinking about this whole new name thing last night, and you know what I realized? I like it.
Robin: You like being called Swarley?
Barney: Are you kidding? I want you to call me that.
Ted: Do you really think this is gonna work?
Barney: Do I think what's gonna work? I'm just saying, I love my new name, so please only call me that from now on.
Ted: Call you what?
Barney: You know, that-that-that new name that you've been calling me.
Ted: Say it.
Barney: Why? You guys know what it is.
Ted: Say the name.
Barney: No, I don't want to! I hate it! I hate it! It's not funny! It's never been funny! I've never done any... No! 
Ted: Man, he is really gonna lose it when all the magazine subscriptions start coming in.
Robin: I signed him up for People in Espanol, but I addressed it to Swarlos.
Lily: Hey, where's the picture of Marshall and me at the pier? Didn't it used to be by that window?
Ted: Oh, yeah, he, uh, he sort of took it down when you left. Put it behind some books, I think.
Lily: Oh, well-well, maybe I should put it back up.
Ted: Why, so Chloe'll see it and get scared off?
Lily: No. So Marshall'll see it and feel guilty. Yeah, okay.
Ted from 2030: But she wasn't okay. Later that night, while Marshall was on his date, Lily came back.
Chloe: ...anymore. Pretty impressive, huh?
Marshall: Wow, you really did memorize all the lyrics to "We Didn't Start the Fire." Can I, uh, can I get you a drink?
Chloe: I'd love a beer.
Marshall: You got it.
Ted from 2030: Lily did what any sensible woman would do. She hid under the desk. And she stayed there, listening to her ex-fiance on a date with another woman.
Chloe: I had a really nice time tonight.
Marshall: Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.
Chloe: I like your eyes a lot, too.
Ted from 2030: Finally, much like Billy Joel, she couldn't take it anymore.
Lily: Stooooop! Hi. I'm Lily.
Marshall: Lily... Lily, what the hell are you doing?
Lily: I don't know. I... I don't know... what I'm doing. Oh, pumpkin beer, that was a good one. I'm just... I'm gonna go. I... I'm so sorry. Enjoy the rest of your date.
Chloe: She seems nice.
Out, building steps.
Marshall: Lily, what the hell...
Lily: I'm sorry. I only snuck up there because... When I saw how cute she was yesterday, I freaked out.
Marshall: Lily, you saw her yesterday?
Lily: Yeah, I... kind of chased her down the street.
Marshall: Wait, so you were the hunchback with the limp?
Lily: Yeah. And she didn't break the picture, I did.
Marshall: So Chloe's not crazy, she's... just a nice, normal girl.
Lily: Yeah, she is. And you deserve a nice, normal girl. So, why don't you just go back up there and finish your date.
Marshall: Yeah. Okay. Wait, if you were the hunchback, then why did she think you were a guy?
Lily: I-I might have used a voice that sounded like this.
Marshall: Why?
Lily: Because I didn't want her to know it was me, which I now realize doesn't make sense, because she hadn't even met me.
Marshall: You're crazy. You have... crazier eyes than anybody that I have ever met.
Lily: Shouldn't you be going back up...
Marshall: I mean, you're out of your mind. You're... just absolutely insane.
Lily: Shouldn't you be going back upstairs?
Marshall: I've missed you so much. 
Ted: Okay, I ran it by the group, and we decided we're gonna give you a choice. We will agree to stop calling you Swarley, but instead, we'll call you Jennifer. Well?
Barney: I'm thinking. How about this? On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, you...
Ted : Hey! Look at this.
Ted from 2030: So right there, in the exact same place that six months earlier I had walked up and found Marshall alone, crying over his breakup with Lily, I found him again. Only this time he wasn't alone, and he was happy. So we went to the bar to celebrate, and it was great. I was with Robin, Marshall and Lily were back together, and Barney had a cool new name. All was right with the world... Until we got back to the apartment.
The apartment. Everything is upside down.
Robin: Oh, my God.
Marshall: Hey, Chloe, I... guess I forgot I left you up here.
Chloe: I was gonna leave, but I can't find my keys.
Marshall: They're right there on the coffee table.
Chloe: Silly me. I must have looked everywhere else. Well... I'm just gonna go. Oh, I don't think we've met. I'm Chloe.
Robin: Robin.
Chloe: It's nice to meet you, Roland. I'll see you guys later.
Barney: Roland? Your name's Roland. That's funny, right? Rock and Roland. Warsaw is the capital of what? Roland. You're Monica Roland-ski. Hey, yeah, that's just how I Roland.
Ted: Nice try, Swarley.
Barney: Damn it.
MacLaren's. Barney arrives.
Everybody: Swarley!
