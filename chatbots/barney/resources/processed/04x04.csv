"Barney arrives at the bar, disguised as a senior.","You there, what's your name?"
"Excuse me?","Your name, woman, what's your name?"
"Wife Cindy.","I knew it. You are ""the"" Cindy, one that can change everything and bring us to our downfall. Listen to me, Cindy. I am Barney Stinson, and I have an urgent mission from the future."
"From the future?","The future, and I can prove it to you. In exactly four seconds, the woman at this table will slap this man."
"What are you doing?","In a few minutes, the young me your time will enter through this door. I know it sounds crazy, but to save the planet, you have to sleep with him tonight."
"You mean what?","I have not the time to explain. I must return to reality accelerator before the vortex closes. Only you can save us, Cindy. I must go!"
"Barney enters the bar.","Vive la vodka."
"My God, you are... ho, my God! I offer you a drink?","I guess I have time for a drink and 45 minutes to an hour for other activities, but after that, I must return to the top secret research project I'm working on."
"Global warming?","My God! How do you know that?"
"It's good enough!","It does not stop a fight between girls! Ever!"
"Barney reaches a bottle in his hand.","This is the man of the evening. It's time to let the monster out of his cage!"
"No.","Come on, man. People want to see Bruce Banner.They want Hulk. What?"
"It's true. We live.","You're going to seriously continue to wear this hat?"
"Then Barney.","What?"
"Specifically, those with fire.","The magic tricks? Guys, interventions are meant to help people, not to address every aspect you do not like.Sorry, but it warms me. It makes me boil! I mean, I am filled with a burning rage! Thanks! Oh, shit."
"What was your biggest problem with me and Stella?","Yes! In the mouth! You said that the ""Barney the future"" work out. You told me I was crazy. My shrink told me I was crazy. Which is the narcissist with severe emotional disorders, Dr. Grossbard? A banner of intervention?That's what?"
"Stella.","""I can not remain indifferent... """
"You kept it on you?","Please. ""I can not remain impassive while you make the biggest mistake a man can do... get married. Keep my words, it will all part... ""Flames! Oh, shit! I sent the flame too soon. I had so many important things to say, and... The fact is, Ted, marriage is stupid. Each year there are a million girls aged 22, sexy, who go to bars and call me, ""glass half full"", but I think they become beasts."
"Even you, you will meet more girls in 22 years when you get 80.","I meet this challenge."
"What challenge?","Prove that I will be just as great at 80. I'll go out with a girl of 22 years with my old man makeup."
"Barney at the bar, again disguised as a senior.","Good evening, young lady. You want a caramel?What do you mean, ""nothing in common""? We're both older."
"You're cute. How old are you?","83 years. How old are you?"
"Oh, my God!","I think someone owes me $ 200."
"Barney, it was not a gamble. Person...","This proves that I will be as great as that when I have 80 years. Tope my arthritis."
"Because it will age like it or not, then the real question is: do we want to go forward or clinging desperately to the past and end up like that?","You mean great? I am 80 years old guy, and I pack a girl of 22 years."
"Take me with you, darling. I want to see your medals from World w*r II.","In an instant my child."
"Okay, it matters not.","What? Why?"
"Amazing.","It's amazing."
"Not at all.","I would much Red Bull."
"Barney enters the apartment, disguised as old.","What...?"
"Barney is an intervention.","Sorry, I hear you."
"That's enough, the trick of ""old.""","The trick in the middle?"
"Forget it.","Leave baby? I love this old rhyme!"
"I will get my problem.","You're going to get my boat?"
