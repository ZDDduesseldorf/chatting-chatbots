"INT. BAR","Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O."
"And why is that girl checking you out?","Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged"
"Yeah, so?","So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?"
"Dammit Past Ted","You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out."
"One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.","Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment."
"Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?","Sort of on a date with her."
"What?","I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile. But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital."
"Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.","Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck."
"Ooh, can I do it?","Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy."
"Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy.","Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?"
"Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.","An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy."
"An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.","Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?"
"Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.","Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there."
"Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there.","See you guys later."
"They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.","Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one."
"One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.","Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike."
"Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?","You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big."
"What, like buy a new sofa?","Bigger."
"Bigger.","Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law."
"A lemon law, like for cars.","Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now."

"Hi, it's good to finally meet you.","Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history."
"Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.","Tell your friends."
"Tell your friends.","It's gonna be a thing."
"You're a jerk.","No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing!"
"For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.","No, wrong, lemon law is awesome."
"It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.","OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy."
"OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy.","You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?"
"Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.","Bad move, Scherbatsky."
"Bad move, Scherbatsky.","Hi, have you met Robin?"
"Hello.","Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law."
"Leave me alone.","4:56, 4:57, 4:58."
"We're only just getting to know each other.","Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital."
"They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine.","So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie."
"So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie.","What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie."
"INT. HOSPITAL WAITNG ROOM","It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law."
"Here here. Cheers","And to the lemon law."
"And to the lemon law.","Self-clink."
