"I had the number of that girl. Look. Holly.","Owl. The girls with a name ending in LY are dirty.Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily."
"Yeah, it's true.","And not to mention the girls with names ending in I instead of a Y. These girls are like rides. You make the long tail, but once inside, you hold on, hoping not to lose your keys."
"You know what I'm going to do? I'll call on. I will do ""you remember me? It's been a "". It's funny because I just saw.","You can not. You must wait three days before calling.This is the rule."
"This rule is completely outdated. They know exactly what you do. I have another rule. It's a bit crazy, but I call it, ""you like him, you call him.""","Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the f*ck."
"My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?","Jesus."
"Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus.","Seriously. Jesus began this thing for three days. He waited three days to return to life. It was perfect. If he had waited one day we would not have known he was dead! They would have said: ""Jesus, are you? ""And Jesus would probably have said,"" You okay? I died yesterday! ""And they would say:"" You have the air alive, man. "" And they should explain his resurrection. And the miracle. And then the guy would say, ""Okay, whatever you want, dude."""
"The dialogues seem pompous old now.","And he will not come back on a Saturday. Everyone is busy doing chores. Weave, cut the beard. No. It looked exactly the right number of days... Three."
"I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking.","And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, ""No, Jesus died."" Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the ""tope there! ""3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story."
"Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards!","What?"
"You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?","We knew he would try to call three days before, so I took his cell phone and changed his number from mine."
"Marshall and Barney are at the bar.","""Piti texting""?"
"Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous.","Yeah. Or... it pretends to Holly and we are in the bath."
"It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us.","It should. Or... it is said that red is our favorite color and found the look ""cowboy"" sexy."
"I wear them right now and they are very sexy.","He put the boots!"
"He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears.","Or... we remove our shirts."
"It's better.","Maybe that door below, a black bra with lace."
"I believe that wearing anything underneath.","It is hot."
"There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go!","Too! Tell him we slowly drag our... What do we do?"
"No, actually it was for his good. It protects it from itself. He really likes this girl. He had that look.","The crazy eyes, ""I'm going too fast and I will f*ck up everything."""
"The same he had with you the first time.","We all know what it gave."
"It's been that Ted did not like someone. He stored much... We thought him to say ""I love you"" when he contacted her.","And it's coming. It shows all the telltale signs."
"First: he jokes with the marriage.","""You like architecture? We should get married. Ha-ha.MDR. Just kidding. So what? """
"Deuzio: it's far too early suggestions crazy travel.","""I like beer. We should go to Germany. MDR. JP.MDR. """
"Third: it says too early personal things.","""My parents divorced two years there. It was really hard. MDR. """
"Yeah, but that's the problem. Ted did not say ""I love you"" as easily as we thought.","And then we met Stan."
"Super Stan. Who is it?","A guard who works nights."
"He eats here every day.","And he had not finished."
"It's... really nice.","No matter. It's OK."
"I do not know... what comes to the bread here, but it touches me... here... and here.","Well, if Ted does not say, I will. I love you."
"It is perhaps not in love with us.","How is this possible? It's all there waiting!"
"That guy you fell in love. I hope his girlfriend is not jealous. He spoke of a friend or...?","All was well until he sends a text message for Lily and ruins everything."
"It's okay. It's over now. I have to leave, but that's what happens: you call it now, tell him what you did and apologize.Got it?","Yes. Or..."
"He replied! ""I probably should not tell you, finally, we barely knew, but never mind, I say it anyway. ""","That's it, man. This is the ""I love you."""
"I would like Stan to be there.","Stan. What?"
"""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend.""","""I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend. """
"Ted Why send text messages to a girl he barely knows, where he says he dreams about me gay?","Easy. You? He speaks clearly to me."
"Dude, I'm his best friend.","Okay, one: It has never been proven. Two: If anyone had any dreams about gays one of us would be on me! Finally, look at me. Now look at you. An octogenarian still in her closet would not be in this state."
"That's the trick. I hug you, no. Who would not want to cuddle in this case, on Sunday morning? Wrapped in the quilt while it is raining, and there are muffins in the oven. I'm cuddly, bitch. You must do.","I train every day. One thing we know about Ted is that he likes a nice body. This body would vibrate."
"Ted and I, we lived. I know what he likes. There are things I can do it... he Ã©poustoufleraient Why do they sleep with Ted?","I know. It's weird."
"Barney and Marshall are in McClaren's with Robin.","Crazy, no? Ted had dreams about me gay."
"It's a bit weird, but... I had a strange dream yesterday. It's a bit embarrassing.","You can tell us. This is a secure area."
"That's it?","No more dreams? Nothing disturbing or erotic?"
"And.. why should I ""make me"" one of you?","Machines force you. They want to watch. That's how they erupt."
"Sorry. It was just trying to help you.","And also, it was really funny."
"Hi, friends.","You work right?"
"Yes.","What..."
"Wait. You can not just sit there and have your date with us?","Yeah, it will be fun! Look, I'm kidding! It explodes! Do you like magic?"
