"Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?","Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either."
"Why?","Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?"
"No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.","Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are."
"Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.","Come on, let's go."
"All right, I'm in.","To the Willowbrook Mall!"
"No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.","Why not?"
"What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?","Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment."
"The 'oh' moment?","Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker."
"It's a promise ring. I made a pact with God to stay a virgin till I'm married.","Oh."
"I don't have an eating disorder. It's just when I put food in my mouth, I chew it and then I spit it out.","Oh."
"I just turned 30.","Oh."
"Oh.","So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible."
"Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.","You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox."
"It's true. They tell each other everything.","I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you"
"Try me.","Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?"
"Doggie ate his pants. Yep.","Bill's bachelor party in Memphis."
"Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?","OK, Seattle."
"Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch.","Damn."
"Yeah, meanwhile, Robin tells me nothing.","Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?"
"You know?","Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p*rn, wait for it, ography."
"My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.","They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess."
"Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted.","Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it."
"Thank you Barney.","'Cause it's p*rn."
"Robin is not in p*rn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.","20,000 says it's p*rn."
"I don't have 20,000.","Well then, what do you have?"
"No.","I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet."
"INT. MACLAREN'S","You, you got something to say to me?"
"See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?","I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress."
"I can see my hand print on your face.","Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of p*rn from Canada I have to go through."
"I won the bet. Why are you still searching?","Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong."
"Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p*rn.","Canadian p*rn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go ""oat"" of my mind."
"You told him? Lily: I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you.","Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk."
"One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.","Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall: No. You're gonna cry."
"I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.","So I just got a very interesting phone call."
"What are you talking about?","I know Robin's secret."
"What?","That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now."
"That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now.","Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this."
"Yeah. No I don't.","What?"
"Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.","Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!"
"Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!","Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing."
"Barney, don't, okay.","Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right."
"I wanna stress that I was young.","Yeah you were."
"And I didn't know any better.","They never do."
"And it started out as an innocent modeling job.","It always does."
"Oh my God.","Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock."
"Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.","I'm gonna go with the five for eternity."
"So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?","Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket."
"Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today!","Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin: Yes."
