EXT. NEW YORK CITY
Future Ted VO: Now I remember a lot of stories from back in the days before I met your mother, but there's one story I don't remember. Uncle Marshall still refers to it as the pineapple incident.
The night started like any other. We were downstairs at the bar.
INT. MACLAREN'S
Carl: On the house.
Everyone: Whoa.
Carl: It's my own concoction. I call it the Red Dragon.
Everyone: Wow. Thanks, Carl.
Ted: We're not really doing shots, are we?
Lily: I hope not.
Barney: No, no.
Lily: These look kinda like blood.
Marshall: OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?
Barney: That's ridiculous.
Marshall: I'm serious. Think about it. He always wears black, we never see him in the daylight, only after dark.
Robin: Oh my God, that does describe a vampire, or you know, a bartender.
Robin: Well, I should go get dressed.
Ted: Where are you going, buddy? Hot date?
Lily: I'll say, she's going out with a billionaire.
Robin: Lily, I told you not to call him that.
Ted: Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire?
Robin: He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred millionaire. Why do people always round up?
Ted: So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you?
Robin: A charity dinner.
Lily: Yeah, $2000 a plate.
Robin: $1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger.
Barney: You gonna put out?
Barney: What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills.
Lily: I think my soul just threw up a little bit.
Robin: Well, I'm gonna be late. You guys have fun. Bye.
Ted: See ya.
Lily: Bye.
Marshall: You OK?
Ted: Sure, why?
Marshall: I don't know. Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire.
Ted: OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for...
Barney: What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go.
Ted: Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?
Barney: Daddy's home.
Ted: Daddy's home?
Barney: Yeah.
Ted: You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Barney.
Barney: Hm. Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.
Marshall: OK, think about this, is there even a single item on the menu that has garlic in it?
Lily: Garlic fries.
Marshall: OK, well, I'll get back to you.
Ted: Oh, daddy's back. See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that...
Barney:  Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh?
Ted: That worked. I hate the world.
Barney: Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.
Marshall: Doo-doo.
Barney: Totally.
Ted: So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped.
Barney: Oh yes it can.
Marshall: Interesting
Barney: Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style.
Ted: So, what? You want me to do a sh*t.
Barney: Oh no. I want you to do five shots.
Marshall: Oooh, more interesting.
Ted: Barney, I think you've officially...
Barney: No, don't think. Do.
Marshall: Ted, he's right. You overthink. Maybe you should overdrink.
Marshall, Barney: Drink, drink, drink, drink...
Ted: Ah, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being?
Lily: Guys, you are being immature and moronic and drink, drink, drink
Marshall, Lily, Barney: Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink...
Marshall, Lily, Barney: Yes! Drink, drink, drink...
Ted: Let me tell you something about this brain, OK?
Marshall, Lily, Barney: Drink! Drink, drink...
Ted: Even alcohol cannot stop this brain.
Barney: I love it, I love it, I love it.
Marshall, Lily: Drink, drink, drink...
Ted: This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain.
Marshall, Lily, Barney: Drink, drink, drink, drink...
Ted: This is a superbrain.
Ted: This brain is unstoppable. This brain...
Future Ted VO: And that's all I remember, except for a few hazy memories.
Future Ted VO: But really, the next thing I remember is waking up the following morning.
INT. TED'S BEDROOM
Future Ted VO: So, there were some unanswered questions.
Future Ted VO: How much did I drink? How did I sprain my ankle?
Future Ted VO: And who was this girl in my bed?
INT. APARTMENT
 Lily: There's our rock star
Ted: OK, what the hell happened last night?
Marshall: You really don't remember, Superbrain?
Future Ted VO: So, Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily filled me in.
Carl: And how did you guys like the shots?
Ted: I drank all five, bitch.
Marshall:  I love drunk Ted.
Ted: Marshall thinks you're a vampire.
Carl: If he pukes, one of you guys cleans it up.
Lily: No dibs. 
Marshall: Oh. 
Barney: No....Dammit.
Ted: How quickly you all forget. I haven't puked since high school. I am vomit-free since ninety-three. Vomit free since ninety-three. That's funny. I'm funny.
Lily: Who are you calling?
Ted: Robin.
Marshall: Oh, bad idea.
Barney: No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober.
Lily: Says every girl you've ever slept with.
Marshall:  Say what?!
Ted: Hello Robin, it's Ted.
Robin: Oh hi Ted.
Ted: Hello Robin, it's Ted.
Robin: Hi Ted. Sounds like you're having fun.
Ted on phone)
Ted: Robin, have I ever told you that I'm vomit-free since ninety-three?
Robin: Listen, Ted, I can't really talk right... '93? Dude, that's impressive.
Ted: I don't say this enough, but you're a great woman, and a great reporter. You should be on 60 Minutes. You should be one of the minutes.
Robin: That's sweet and odd. But I'm kinda on a date right now.
Ted: Yeah, and I disagree with Barney. Just 'cause this guy is spending a lot of money doesn't mean you have to put out. Take it slow, Robin, take it slow. Slow.
Robin: Bye Ted.
Ted: Slow.
Marshall: Wow, right, that's why we don't do shots.
Lily: Friends don't let friends drink and dial.
Ted: I need that phone back.
Lily: You'll get this back at the end of class.
Barney: Ding, class dismissed. Here you go, kid, you call whoever you want.
Ted: Thank you kind sir. At least someone appreciates the fact that I'm doing and not thinking. And now I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom.
Lily: Was that necessary? He is not making smart decisions. Barney: Exactly. It's like, what's he gonna do next. I don't know, but I want to find out.
Marshall: Cheap Trick? Oh Ted.
Robin: Hello again, Ted.
Ted: Hey, it's me again.
Ted:  Plain to see again.
Ted:  Please can I see you every day?
Ted:  I love everyone in this bar.
Marshall: And we love you, drunk Ted.
Ted:  I'm a fool again.
Ted:  I fell in love...
Robin: Ted?
Ted: Well, that explains the ankle.
Lily: And then we brought you home and put you to bed.
Ted: Was there anyone else in there with me?
Lily: There's a girl in there.
Ted: I know.
Marshall: And a pineapple.
Ted: I know.
Lily: Who is she?
Ted: I don't know.
Ted: What the hell happened to my jacket? Marshall: Whoa.
Lily: That girl in there is alive, right? Ted: I should call Barney, maybe he knows what happened.
Barney: Hello.
Ted: Why are you sleeping in our tub?
Barney: The porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling.
Lily: Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?
Barney: Don't worry, I slept through it.  I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big t*nk.
Marshall: How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around one.
Barney: Oh, you put Ted to bed all right.
Ted: You guys take care of me. You guys are the best. I love you guys so much.
Lily: Good night, Ted.
Marshall: Love you too, buddy.
Ted: I'm back baby doll!
Barney: Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now.
Barney: All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one?
Ted: I think....
Barney: Ehhh! Trick question, no thinking. You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride.
Ted: Bring it.
Barney: Have you met Ted?
 Barney: Excuse me.
Barney: You're calling Robin.
Ted: I'm calling Robin.
Barney: Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her.
Ted: Oh yeah? What you gonna do?
Barney: If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire.
Ted: You're bluffing.
Ted: Hello, Robin, it's Ted.
Robin: Ted, for the last time, stop.
Robin: Ted!
Ted: You set me on fire.
Barney: Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast. You got robbed, this is a blend.
Ted: You set me on fire. And who's the girl in my bed?
 Barney: There's a girl in your bed.
Marshall: And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?
Barney: Who is she?
Ted: I have no idea.
Barney: Nice.
Ted: You really don't know who that is?
Barney: No, after I hosed you down with a beverage g*n, I brought you back here.
Ted: I better not have gotten b*rned.
Ted: Did any of you write that?
Lily:  Hi, I'm Ted, if lost, please call...Who's number is that?
Ted: I don't know.
Marshall: Dude, call it. Hold on, I'm gonna make some popcorn.
Marshall: OK, you can call now. God, this is intense, I love it.
Guy: Hello.
Ted: Uh, hi, who is this?
Guy: You called me, who's this?
Ted: It's Ted.

INT. MACLAREN'S
Carl: It's Carl, from the bar.
INT. APARTMENT
Future Ted VO: And then Carl filled us in.
Ted: Barney, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar. Go into my stable and take my finest stallion. He's yours, his name is Windjammer.
Barney: Sleep it off, bra.
Ted: I'm back, baby doll! Ted: And I am gonna throw up.
Ted: I threw up? My streak is over. Vomit-free since '05 doesn't sound good. Sorry, Carl, go on.
Ted: Carl, did you know the word karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra? Isn't that hauntingly beautiful? Are you a vampire? Carl: I am cutting you off. Go home and get some sleep, Ted.
Ted: Yeah, sun's gonna come up soon. Wouldn't want to be around for that, would we?
Ted: Hey, how easy do you think it'll be to sneak into the zoo? I have to see some penguins, like right now.
Carl: Give me your arm.
Carl: This way, if you pass out in the gutter...
Ted: That tickles.
Carl: Someone will call me and I will come get you.
Ted: Thanks Carl. We can't just be friends, we're attracted to each other and we both know it.
Carl: Excuse me?
Ted: Me and Robin. Me and Robin, I have to make one more call.
Carl: Yeah, this'll go good.
Ted: Hey, it's me again. Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life, so shy don't you come over to my apartment and we'll think of something stupid to do together? Really? Great. Wait, really? Great.
Ted: Thanks Carl.
Ted: It's Robin. That's Robin in there.
Marshall: Did you guys?
Barney: Oh come on. You've gotta give me this one. Those five shots got you farther with Robin than your brain ever did. See what happens when you don't think? You do! More importantly, you do Robin. Come on.
Lily: All right, right over here.
Ted: Still, what does this mean? Are we dating now? I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it...
Barney: Someone get him a sh*t, he's thinking again.
Marshall: Maybe it's not such a bad idea to think about this one. You and Robin went down this road before, you got dinged up pretty bad.
Lily: You know who might have something to say about Ted's future with Robin? Robin. Go wake her up.
Ted: Wake her up and say what?
Barney: Daddy's home.
Marshall: Good luck buddy.
INT. TED'S BEDROOM
Ted: Hello.
Robin: Ted, it's Robin.
Ted: Are you sure?
INT. APARTMENT
Ted: Hey, Robin, how are you?
Robin: Ted, I think you and I should have a talk about those phone calls last night. Do you mind if I swing by?
Marshall: Ask her about the pineapple.
Ted: Yeah, sure, come on over.
Robin: Thanks.
Ted: No, wait, don't, no.
Ted: She's coming over. Crap.
Lily: Wait, this is k*ll me. We have to find out who that girl is.
Trudy: Trudy. My name is Trudy.
Future Ted VO: And then Trudy filled us in.
Trudy's friend: I'm just surprised you didn't dump him sooner.
Trudy: I know, it's two years of my life I'm never getting back. A little part of me just wants to jump the bones of the next guy I see.
Barney: Daddy's home.
Trudy: Or the one after that.
Barney: OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy.
Barney: Ladies.
Ted: I love everyone in this bar.
Trudy's friend: Look at that idiot go.
Trudy: He's kinda cute.
Ted: What are you doing in the men's room? What am I doing in the ladies' room? Oh right, I came in here 'cause I thought I was gonna throw up.
Trudy: Did you?
Ted: I did not.
Ted: And the streak continues. Vomit-free since '93.
Ted: Sorry, Trudy, go on.
Trudy: I liked your performance.
Ted: What? The karaoke? Domo arigato.
Trudy: I wish I had your guts, getting up and making a complete idiot of myself.
Ted: Do it.
Trudy: I don't know. Still, I've had a pretty serious week. I could sure stand to do something stupid.
Ted: I'm something stupid, do me.
Trudy: You're funny.
Ted: Hey, can I call you sometime? Trudy: OK.
 Trudy: Here, let me.
Ted: Why do they call it karaoke anyhow? Was it invented by a woman named Carrie Okie? These are the kinds of things I think about. Trudy: Karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra.
Ted: That's hauntingly beautiful.
Ted: Hey, it works.
Trudy: Then I guess you're gonna have to call me.
Ted: I need to make one more call.
Trudy: Hello.
Ted: Hey, it's me again.
Trudy: Hey.
Ted: Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life.
Trudy: So I came over here. And now I'm really, really embarrassed.
Marshall: Dammit, Trudy, what about the pineapple? Sorry.
Ted: Uh, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.
Trudy: Why, is that your girlfriend?
Ted: No, that's not my girlfriend. Look, it's complicated.
Trudy: You're married. Yeah, I can't believe I did this.
Ted: No, I'm not married. Um, I'll explain after you hide.
Ted: Hi.
Robin: Hey guys.
Barney: Robin.
Lily: Hi Robin.
Barney: Top of the morning.
Ted: Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was very drunk.
Robin: No kidding. Those calls were really weird. Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk.
Lily: Let's go get a snack.
Marshall: I love to snack.
Barney: I'm good.
Ted: Come on, those calls weren't that weird.
Ted:  Robin! Come hang out! OK, I'm gonna make this sound until you come hang out.
Robin: That goes on for three-and a half minutes.
Ted: Without a breath? That's gotta be some kind of record.
Robin: Ted, you can't do this. Please, we're to be friends and now you're making it all confusing.
Ted: No I'm not. Look, I just turned off my brain for the night. Nothing's changed, you've moved on, I've moved on.
Robin: Really, you moved on?
Ted: Yes. What, you don't believe me?
Ted: Oh, OK.
Ted: Trudy, come on out.
 Ted: You are gonna laugh.
Robin: Wait, you were with someone last night? Ted: Yeah, Trudy, she's cool.
Ted: Trudy, come on out.
Ted: Seriously, it's OK. This is so Trudy. She's really shy, I think.
Ted: Trudy?
INT. TED'S BEDROOM
Robin: Hi Trudy, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you. You're right, she is shy.
Ted: I'm not making this up. She must have climbed out the fire escape.
Ted: Whatever, whatever. I don't care what you think.
Robin: Then why did you hide her from me? Ted: Wow, you're good. Did anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes?
Robin: Yes, you did, last night.
Ted: Really? Well.
Robin: Get some sleep, Ted. You had a long night. And don't feel bad, I've woken up with worse.
Future Ted VO: I left Trudy a message but she never called me back. That's just how life works sometimes. You turn off your brain for a night, and all you're left with is a bad hangover, a sprained ankle.
INT. APARTMENT
Future Ted VO: Oh, and we never found out where that pineapple came from, but it was delicious.
