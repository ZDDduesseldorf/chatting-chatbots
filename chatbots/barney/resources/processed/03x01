I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready.---When will you be ready?
I grew my breakup beard.---Ted Mosby, suit up, 'cause here's the plan. There's a Miss Nassau County pageant. We'll pretend to be judges and, yes, our votes are for sale.
I repainted the apartment.---Finish line of a woman 10K. Salty girls on an endorphin high who just want to lie down. Yeah.
And the truth is, I was doing really good.---Female acrobats from Montreal. Super flexible. We're going to get "Cirque de So-Laid". What up?
That's my wife.---Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name?
Gael.---Kyle?
What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.---That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner.
Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time.---How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.
How do you know?---Glad you asked Lily. I have crafted a list of every vehicle land-based, aquatic and airborne in which/on which it's possible to have sex. And of those 33 vehicles, I have had sex in/on 31. Windsurfing board, not on the list, not possible. Oh, P.S., in order to hit 33, all I need is bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule.
To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian.---This conversation never happened.
All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing.---Yes!
"I just want to make sure you're okay with this"? Damn it! I can't believe she's the one that gest to say that. She's winning, isn't she?---Hum-hum. Not for long. Okay, pep talk. Take a knee. Ted, tonight, we're going to get you someone way hotter than Robin. Okay, Robin's a ten. Fine we'll get you a 12. Or, you know... two sixes. Failing that, four threes. And break glass in case of emergency we'll go the Staten Island, I'll get you 12 ones. Ted, my boy, I'm going to re-teach you... Ah.
Ted.---Barney. Ted, we are back. Up here. Up high. Fivin' it up five-style!
What?!!---Let's bail, this place is dead.
Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out.---Yes, exactly, plus, we're on a tight schedule. I've got the entire evening perfectly planned out... Spoiler alert: Our last stop is an after hours club so after hours, it's three days from now. What up?
Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning.---Yeah. But I didn't get to help.
So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her?---Apology accepted. Let's go.
Hum. This is Barney. Barney, Amy.---I'm not gonna remember that. Now, if you'll excuse me, random chick from earlier tonight, as you shall henceforth be known. Ted and I have a schedule to keep.
Oh, well. You can check out off 08:54, dress up like a dork and bother the cool kids. b*at it, nerd.---Wow. Wow. Great stuff, Tommy Lee. See what you don't understand is, I'm Ted wingman. It's a sacred bond, much stronger that any... They're making out again!
The night was doing great. Amy was cool and dangerous. She found a friend for Barney. She even paid for drinks... sort of.---They know us here! You're gonna get us in trouble.
Tell me something. Do you ask your tailor to leave extra room in the crotch for your huge vagina?---You... your vagina... Ted, this chick is crazy. We're leaving.
Good idea. Let's all go back to my place.---Your place? Thanks, but no thanks, 1994 Courtney Love.
Oh, thanks. You should get one.---Wrong. Ted has a classic clean-cut look that never goes out of style season after season, burn.
Yeah? Well. I think he would look hot with some ink.---No, he wouldn't.
Yes, he would.---No, he wouldn't.
Yuh-huh.---Nuh-uh.
I'm ready to do anything you want by the way. Anything. Right now.---Ted. Who are you gonna side with on this tattoos thing?
Sorry. I used to nanny for those jerks before they fired me. So unfair.---Unfair? I wouldn't let you take care of the imaginary kids I make up to score with single moms. That's it Ted, we're going home. Ted? Ted, you okay?
I'm okay. In fact, here's how okay I am. I'm gettin' a tattoo.---You're not getting a tattoo. It's not you. Ted, you are heading down a dark path.
That dark path is my driveway.---But you need a plan and you need a wingman!
But you need a plan and you need a wingman!---This is so going in my blog!
Want to have sex?---Okay.
Hum. Really, never? Not even if, say, butterflies flew out of his ass?---What?
Hum. Hum. What?---Ted?
Hmm?---I came here this morning because... I want to apologize.
Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter.---See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now.
Hmm.---Since you and Robin split, you've been gestating. Growing in your cocoon. And last night... you burst out of that cocoon..., like a majestic, uh... gosh, what is it that comes out of a cocoon? I was always bad at science.
A butterfly? What?---Nothing, buddy.
Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God! I have a tattoo.---Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp.
Tramp stamp?---You know, a ho tat. Ass antlers. A Panama City license plate.
No no no no no no no. Give me this.---Oh, yeah, that'll get it out.
Kids, I can't remember exactly what helped me get through the whole Robin-Gael incident. I'm sure it was something profound and meaningful and not at all macho and petty. But after that, I was back on my feet. And what followed was a new era in my life. A crazy time unlike anything that came before. It's funny looking back on those days, knowing now exactly what I was heading towards, and what was heading towards me.---Go for Barney.
Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something.---What is it?
Just a new website. Slapcountdown.com.---What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?
What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?---No. No!
