"Okay, big guy, tell me all along.","It all started a week ago."
"Barney is at McLaren's.","I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady."
"Nothing is sexier than a man wearing a nice tie.","Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie."
"End flashback","She did it too!"
"Right.","So, right after that, I took her home."
"When I'm in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger to satisfy every single... the carnal desires of my lover.","Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow."
"Good night.","What? Wait, what? I thought your body would become a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger only to satisfy my every carnal desires."
"Ted, Marshall and Lily's apartment and listen to Barney.","I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners."
"I'm in the inter-gender-ing, and I have some sex-seconds before the light turns green. And then, everyone honks, and it really sex, but I can not run because a jogger slips and falls in the Sacraments of sex-horse.","Continuous. Continues."
"It's the cashmere?","Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns."
"12 microns. I like the tight fibers.","Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle."
"Barney at the bar with a woman.","You try this shit of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail."
"It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass.","Did you just say you got a kid!"
"You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date.","Completely."
"Or the second. Or the third.","Of course. Well..."
"Or the fourth.","Just tell me how!"
"17.","Excuse me, someone is using this stool?"
"If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up.","I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted..."
"From Robin is Robin.","I can have two shots ahead. There is a flaw in there and I will get it."
"You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you.","I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan: I'll sleep with her."
"The band is at the bar.","This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger. I put on the StairMaster and..."
"It does.","Spoilers. Regardless, we did."
"Ted and Barney are at McLaren's.","Shit. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do?"
"There is another option... but you're not ready.","Tell me."
"If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.","A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?"
"If you want my help, it's a super hot date.","Okay."
"Let me do it. I will plan everything.","You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?"
"Cutesy and romantic? No need to take him to Paris or Peru...","What are you doing?"
"You just gotta make him understand...","They look at us."
"How important it is for you...","Really? You really gonna do that?"
"In your super hot date, Global problems will simply be put aside, for wonders and surprises that will be the stars. Hurry, do not be late because together, you will find a country where paradise is rebukes. And then, boom! Fireworks in the sky over Manhattan! You kiss him. And your super hot date.","It looks to me like cutesy and romantic. Box strip?"
"Barney and whistles will open the door of his apartment.Marshall followed between Ted and Lily, and he will give a punch in the robot's head of Barney.","Why did you do that?"
"Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire.","Why are you angry against me?"
"You were a real assh*le to Robin when she was in her period of mourning.","The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning."
"Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you.","What, she is upset?"
"Flashback","You should have seen."
"I'm going.","We go back home..."
"Barney throws his hat into the robot.","I can not believe that Robin is upset."
"And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.","I did worse after the premiere of ""The Phantom Menace.""It's been like that since we broke up?"
"Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where.","I know where."
"Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date.","I know you're upset."
"She pulls without the headphones on, then ends up throwing his g*n because there is more balls.","You sure you're not upset?"
"Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?","You're not another number for me."
"And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks.","I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?"
"Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you.","Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want."
"Do not sleep with Anita.","I promise."
"Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?","It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go."
"Anita Barney comes to see who is at the bar with Ted, Marshall and Lily.","I wanted to call you."
"I violate any rules in my coming here, but... no one asks me rabbit like that, so we go out or not?","I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no."
"I see. You try the trick of ""no."" You really think it'll work?Because it will not work. Okay, I'll make a deal. Maybe... you might get lucky after the 12th hot date.","No."
"The 11th?","No."
"The fifth?","No."
"Tonight?","No."
"This evening before dinner?","No."
"Go.","I'm sorry. The answer is no."
"She slides in the hollow of the ear. He gets up and leaves. He descends the stairs and jump over a fence and landed in the water.","Here is my story."
"A fireworks bursting in the sky while Barney is on the bench wrapped in a blanket.","I hope so too."
