Robin: I do not know why you act like that. Maybe you've never had a better job offer, but I still can, so I really want to focus.
Don: I've already spent on the cable.
Robin: You're already past the cable?
Don: It was the best weekend of my life. When you do the newspaper, you're sitting on ergonomic seats, you feel like sitting on a cloud, which was good also because it was just after my colonoscopy. And the locker room, wow.
Mike: There are changing rooms?
Don: Oh yes there was the break, Mike. We will not change in the toilets of KFC on the other side of the street. Oh no. It was heaven. But once you get used to, they will not care at the door to find someone who is not undergoing divorce, or who is not addicted to gin. And before you know it, you find yourself in a dead end, surrounded by people who are going nowhere in their careers, making these programs in their underwear.
Robin: ok, the trick underwear was your choice. And I would not keep that going.
Don: You are beautiful guys. It's comfortable eh?

Barney: My God, I hope that Arthur is well. I reserve her office in case.
Ted: We must stop smoking.
Lily, with a deep voice: Baby, you said it was going.
Marshall: I would never have started. I finally revisit in 13 years, if I could go back. (Young Marshall went camping with a buddy and they smoke. Older Marshall arrives and pat the hand of young Marshall to drop the cigarette. It gives him a punch in the stomach) I hate that little bastard.
Lily: Me too.
Ted: Ok it's good, we stop.

Marshall: Lily God, no.
Lily: Sorry darling, that's for the team.
Robin: I do not want to have sex with Marshall.
Marshall: Sure.
Robin: I can not stop now, not before the most important interview of my life. It's too stressful.
Barney: It's too stressful!
Marshall: Just one.
Lily: Give a cigarette!
Ted: Damn Robin, think about it a moment, Blue Bug is the mayor anti cigarette. You really want to go to the interview smelling cigarettes? It's like interviewing a feeling the vegetarian steak.
Marshall: Really, it's hard enough like that?
Ted: You stop! It all stops.
Robin: Ok, I stop.
Ted: We should just spend the first 24 hours after a piece of cake.
26 hours later... Lily, Marshall, Ted and Barney are at the bar and the table is filled with food.
Lily: Barney stops eating your fingers.
Barney: I do not bite my nails, I try to suck the rest of nicotine on my fingers.
Ted: Marshall pass me your plate.
Marshall: What, you're a dinosaur?
Barney: What do cigarettes now? You believe they think of us?
Ted: Dude, if you do not stop moving your feet, I'll tear it off.
Marshall: Oh Ted, I'm sorry, maybe I should move closer to your ass!
Ted: Ok we'll do it now!
Ted (2030): Nobody knew why we fight. We just knew we wanted to smoke more than anything. It was not great for Robin either.
Don, who arrive without pants: Sorry I'm late. Someone used the microwave, and I got stuck in the elevator. What are you doing?
Robin Don, seriously, not tonight. I'm on my nerves, because I had quit smoking for the interview the mayor.
Don: Oh my little princess porcelain, why would you do that?
Robin: Why? Because it is important to Don, the issue is important and my career. Not like you, you incompetent. You're boring, you are bad, and I want you to work at least as hard as the elastic of your underwear.
Don: I begin to believe that it becomes personal.
Robin: No gift, it would become personal if I told you that just because you pass emission issue, it's because you're losing. A loser lazy and obnoxious.
Don: The mayor canceled.
Mike: 5... 4... 3... 2...
Robin: Hello, this is Robin Scherbatsky.
Don: You think I'm a loser? You're right, I'm a but at least I accept it.
Robin: A raccoon has bitten a patient in a nursing home.
Don: I was like you at first, I always wanted more, and I had nothing. This is a dead Robin, you'll never be a superstar of television. Since you never stop smoking.
Robin: What are you doing?
Don: I like my cigarette. Oh that's good. Want a latte?
Robin: You can be professional?
Don: Yes professional, you know who holds the camera? A chair, even the cameraman is not looking our show and that's why the mayor has canceled. And Mike went to fast food, and that you and I can enjoy a cigarette here.
Robin: No thank you.
Don: Why? Because there are millions of viewers? If viewers are problems with this, call us at the number on the screen: 212-555-0192. Go robin, appreciate life a little. (She takes the cigarette when the phone rings) It must be Mike, he always forgets to take them into extra-crunchy.
Marshall: Robin, do not smoke this cigarette.
Robin: Marshall?
Marshall: They look at you all, we are all impressed and if you smoke this cigarette, we shall return it to us too.
Robin: You watch the show?
Lily: Yes sweetie, and you are very pretty.
Robin: Oh guys.
Ted: You do not have to do that, you do not need to smoke.

Lily: We will not smoke.
Barney: I have a hiding on the roof.
They get up and go on the roof. Robin arrives.

Robin: I bought a packet on the way home.
Marshall: Robin Good show.
Lily: And this guy So what con.
Robin: He ended up apologizing.
Lily: When he got up, the forms were more revealing, you should go out with him.
Robin: We believe in it all.
Ted (2030): They went out together three months later. But we will come back.
Ted: Well look, the sun rises.
Robin: You know it's the perfect time there. For one last cigarette. The real last.
Barney: Come on, let's do it.
Marshall: The last three.
Ted: A...
Lily:... two...
Robin:... three.
Ted (2030): We all stopped for a while after that. But this was not the last, even though we ended up really stop. Robin was arrested in June 2013. Barney in March 2017. Lily stopped from the moment she wanted to get pregnant. Marshall stopped when it was Dad. And my last two weeks before I met your mother, and I did most affected.
Marshall will see Marshall in his young day camping with her boyfriend. Buddy runs away when he saw Marshall get older.
