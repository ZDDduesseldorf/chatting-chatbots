Ted, Lucy and Tnny arrive.
Ted: Let me talk to Stella first.
Lucy: Mom! Ted invited Dad!
Stella: Hi, my heart. You've missed. Just one second, OK?Tony invited you? At our wedding? This was discussed. No ex at our wedding. Why did you do that?
Robin comes up behind Ted.
Robin: What did Ted this time?
Ted and Stella are isolated in their room to talk.
Stella: What does Robin here? I thought I was clear. No ex at our wedding.
Ted: To be fair... your ex is here.
Stella: You've invited!
Ted: Come on, it's not weird.
Stella: It's weird. It is as if it was not over between you. Tony and... I can not look after him. Will you tell him to leave? You can say it's my fault. I'll talk to Robin, she knows it's not personal.
Ted (2030): The children, if I had left Stella talking to Robin, this story would have ended differently.
Stella speaks with Robin.
Robin: I understand.
Ted talks to Tony.
Tony: I get it.
Man: For the first time, Ted and Stella Mosby.
In 2030...
Ted (2030): And now, how I met your mother.
Stella: Your father has finally finished drooling? Who wants ice cream?
Ted (2030): But I have not done.
Ted: You can talk to Tony? Robin made the trip from Tokyo. I should talk to him.
Stella: Of course.
Ted goes to talk to Robin.
Ted: Sorry to have run away like that.
Robin: It's OK. Can you imagine not traveling I did. I was on a plane, a whole day. But it was worth it to see you get married.How I would have missed it...
Ted: You can not come to the wedding.
Robin: thank you God!
Ted: What?
Robin: It's weird.
Ted: It's not weird.
Robin: It's weird. You know how it feels to be one of the former married?
Robin imagine the scene.
Stella: Take that, bitch! I won!
Ted: It was broken, there is more than a year.
Robin: Yes, but it's not that long ago. See you marry another woman is not really something I look forward to. I just thought if I changed my mind about marriage and children, it was nice knowing you were there.
Ted: So, I was your backup plan. It's flattering.
Robin: That's not it. It's just...
Ted: Why do you mention that? There was nothing between us.
Robin: Maybe so. I mean, of course it does. The kind of thing that leaves no one fell swoop. I'm not a guest over.
Ted: It's true. We went out together, but... we have moved on.And we got what we wanted. I marry, You have the job of your dreams in Tokyo. And they lived happily...
Robin: I quit my job.
Ted: You what?
Robin: I return to New York. I thought I wanted this job, but...Getting back to my real life. And you should go back to yours.
Ted: What does that mean?
Robin: You married. Listen, this is precipitated. It's as if you started a book by the end. You are the most romantic. You stole a blue horn for me. You tried to make rain.
Ted: I did the rain.
Robin: It was a coincidence. After all this is how your romantic quest comes to an end? You hide in the wedding of another in his house in his life, without thinking twice. This is not the end spectacular than you deserve. It's not Ted Mosby.
Ted: I love Stella. This is good. If you feel it all... I think it is good that you come to the marriage.
Bartender: Big fight?
Robin: Yes.
Barman: There you go. It is for me.
Robin: You stop it. (Robin drinks the glass of a sudden) My God, so, stop.
Robin knocks on a bedroom door. Barney opens half naked.
Robin: I spend a very bad day. I've stolen scotch at the duty free. It tells you?
Barney: Let's go to your room. Far from it. And can be the whistle.
Robin: I have no room. In fact, I thought I could stay with you.
Barney: No problem. I just need to tidy up a little. Of clothes on the floor and...
Robin: And a girl naked, tied to your bed.
Barney: The towels in the bathroom, a real mess. So, give me 10 minutes... to restore order...
Robin: In addition, Barney.
Robin takes his suitcase and leaves. Nora arrives at that time.
Nora: OK, let's go. Who's that?
Barney: The girl on reception.
Ted (2030): Children, sometimes you think you live a story, but the truth turns out to be quite different. (Robin is on board a boat, Ted is in his room and read a map and Stella is also on board) In those days, I thought it covered only the presence of Robin marriage. (Stella Tony covers his coat) If only I had understood what it was about.
