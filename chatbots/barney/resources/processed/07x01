Ted : Children, if there is a major theme in this story, and I swear, it's almost, really, not quite at the end of the story.This is timing. The timing makes all the difference. For example, I never met your mother if it was not for a wedding.The last of the weddings that I thought would be.
Ted enters a room where Barney.
Barney: What do you think of this tie?
Ted: Thank you, God. Barney Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a dead prostitute in the closet, right?
Barney: This one is better?
Ted: The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage.
Barney: I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie? Ted, I can tell you a big secret?
Ted: Yeah, sure.
Barney: I do not really talk about the tie.
Ted: Yeah, I realized that Barney.
Barney: I wonder if this will be a disaster. And if it was the worst of all marriage?
Ted: Impossible. It has already been the worst of all marriage.
Barney: That of Punchy.
Ted: Marshall has really ruined all that.

Mosbius Designs went bankrupt. But the love of Alex and Jessica reminds us that... Oh, my God!

Robin: My God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between the annoying friend of Ted and that is what this-face. A little respect.
Barney: It's not just be someone. This is a market survey. You see, my legendary success rate of 83%...
Ted: 17. He always reverse.
Barney:... never happens by accident. Each technique used to drag a woman has been thoroughly field tested. By eliminating improper techniques in small markets like Cleveland. I know which will go to New York. For example, tonight marks the inauguration of the escaped prisoner. Do prisoners on the run are sexy?
All: No, no.
Barney: We'll never know unless I try tonight.

Marshall: I'll do it for the child.
Kelly and Punchy: Go Browns!
Marshall: During the season of super bowl, but if they mean the super bowl. Go Vikings.

It takes a rugby ball and throws...
Ted : Children, do you remember when I see have said that Marshall would ruin the marriage of Punchy and Kelly? It was not that either.
Robin: Barney and I have tried and failed. It was there two years. Why would I start? It would not make sense.
Lily: It does not make sense. It's chemistry. Listen, I always them a sixth sense for these things. And now that I'm pregnant... deep in me in my uterus, I see things more clearly. You and Barney have that kind of chemistry that is still there.
Robin: Really? That's why he tries to Lebron anything that moves?
Barney: It does not work for you because A vampires are offside, B or pretend that I invented Facebook was a bit too?
The woman leaves.
Lily: You're the reason why he never called Nora. You're the reason why he only tests tonight. And you're the reason why he continues to try to impress. Chemistry.
Marshall: Wow! Ted! It's really you on the cover of New York.Now, you say "yes."
Ted: Stop please.
Man: Schmosby. What is this magazine?

Marshall: You know what? This is not nothing. Clay, my friend Ted has designed a building, Clay. What do you do, Clay?
Clay: Well, I'm still working in the rental car...
Marshall: Hear, hear, Clay. No major publication does write about your small agency?
Clay: No, no, no items. My life is monotonous. I think the only news is that little thing.
Marshall: Oh my God, look at this little baby. She's so cute. All I want is to put her little feet in my mouth. You have created something really beautiful.
Clay: It's all for me.
Ted: I mean, it's still huge... The building, you know?
Marshall: Hey, kid.  So this little angel is already every night?
Ted: I spent many sleepless nights... to design this building. Nothing symbolism there.
Robin: Forget it. There is no chemistry between Barney and me. It's over.
Lily: Oh really? Prove it. Go talk to him.
Robin: Why should I tell him about that?
Lily: Because in the depths of himself, even if he does not know yet, Barney wants to be with you. And if it does not happen, he deserves to know.
Robin: Well. Barney, just to make things clear...
Barney: I know what you gonna say. Show in Cleveland, how it goes.
He pulls him and takes him to dance.
Robin: Barney... I...
Barney's phone rings.
Barney: Sorry. Oh, my God, this is Nora. She finally ended up reminding me.
Robin: Wait, you said you'd never recalled.
Barney: I lied. I called, like, five times. Wait, wait! You guys you know better than anyone how I show this stuff. Will you help me please? I would like just once to see what it feels like when you do not quite fair.
Robin: Yeah.
Barney: Hi Nora. Thank you for reminding me. The reason I'm calling...
Robin: To tell you how I feel.
Barney: To tell you how I feel.
Robin: I know it did not work the first time...
Barney: I know it did not work the first time...
Robin:... and it makes no sense...
Barney:... and it makes no sense...
Robin:... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.
Barney:... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.
Robin: Is there a part of you that wants to try again?
Barney: Is there a part of you that wants to try again?
Barney thank Robin walking away.
Marshall returns to see Lily with a baby in her arms.
Marshall: Baby, I can not do that. I have to tell someone that we are pregnant.
Lily: Eriksen, be strong. Keep it a secret.
Marshall: There are babies everywhere. It's minefield of sweetness. Look at this little bastard.
Lily: Marshall, stop that. Remains strong. Can not you let me hold a little baby with his little cheeks... so cute... and little arms and little legs... This little bastard has dimples. We will tell everyone I'm pregnant.
Marshall: Yeah!
Robin comes out on the terrace and found there Ted.
Ted: Are you okay?
Robin: No. And you?
Ted: Not really. Want to talk?
Robin: Not even a little bit.
Ted: It might help you feel better.
Robin: Okay, well, we'll make a deal. You go first and then I still do not tell you what's wrong.
Ted: Okay. All my friends from high school, are there with their wives and children. And me? My appointment is a dirty magazine.
Robin: As in high school. Sorry, I had to.
Ted: I've always believed in fate, you know? I will go in a magazine Bagel, I would see a pretty girl in the queue reading my favorite novel, whistling the song I had all week in my head, and I would think, "Wow, this is perhaps the good. " Now I think "I just know that bitch will take the latest Bagel."
Robin: You've been too focused on your work.
Ted: No, it's more than that. I stopped believing. Not like some depressed, I cry during my speech. Not the way I had not even noticed, until tonight. It's just that every day I think I believe a little less and a little less and less. And... it sucks. What should I do about it, Scherbatsky?
Robin: You're Ted Mosby. You do it again to believe it.
Ted: What, in fate?
Robin: A chemistry. If there is alchemy, you just need another thing.
Ted: What is it?
Robin: The timing. But the timing is a bitch.
Ted: Hey, we always have our market 40 years? If you are still only 40 years...
Robin: I'm all yours. Unrelated, architects make a lot?
Ted: Not enough.
Robin: Shit.
Man: Schmosby to you in two minutes.
Robin: Ok, promise me two things. One, believe in you again, and two, do not cry during the toast, Schmosby.
Ted: I promise.
Lily: We're having a baby.
Robin: For real?
Lily: For real.
Ted, Barney and Robin: Oh! Oh!
Voices: A little attention everyone! This is the time for which we are all here tonight. The speech Schmosby!
Ted: We are here tonight to celebrate love. The love that brings us a new life...
Marshall: Hey!  This is not a whiner. They are tears of joy. Ted is happy for his friends because it's the best guy I know. And do you know why he is happy? For the beautiful young lady is pregnant here.
Kelly: How did you know...? It must have a secret!
Ted : It turns out that...
Flashback
Kelly: Will the Browns!
Kelly gives his glass to Punchy and he just takes his own drinking.
Marshall: In the season's Super Bowl, but if they mean the Super Bowl. Go Vikings!
End flashback
Kelly's father: How dare you? This is my daughter, sort of junk.
Punchy: You always pay for it all, eh?
Punchy's father: "Species of junk"? This is my son.
Ted : And that's how Marshall has destroyed the marriage of Punchy. But we did not care. It would be a sixth member in our family.
Back to today...
Ted: No marriage will be as bad as that one, huh?
Barney: I chose the right tie, huh?
Ted: You've nailed. And be glad it is not the tie-duck. Oh, the tie-duck.
Ted : This is a good story. I will return. We are not even close to the end.
Barney: You're a good best man, Ted. You'll cry during the toast, right?
Ted: Oh, I'll cry too.
A knock on the door.
Barney: Between.
Lily: Ted, the bride wants to see you. Seriously? Will you be wearing this tie?
